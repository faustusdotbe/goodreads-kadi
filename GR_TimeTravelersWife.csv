"1","The time traveler's wife"," Andrea",""," I m only adding this book because it annoys me that it popped up on the most popular reads People this book is terrible Do yourself a favor and pretend you d never heard of it My short answer is that it s just no good the long version is in the following list which I call The Problems I Have With The Time-Traveler s Wife The author is indecisive Rather than accepting that this is a science-fiction novel she tries to write a social commentary romance and art and music novel all rolled into one There is so much name-dropping that it s distracting classical music entomology poetry romance languages library science the American punk scene constructivist painters you get the idea they re all continually cropping up at the most inane times What should give us a better understanding of the characters actually paints them as shells of people identified only by superficialities There is one completely pointless mention of a Moholy-Nagy poster that really annoyed me I had five years of design school and while I know who Laszlo Moholy-Nagy is and how to correctly pronounce his name I couldn t pick one of his paintings out of a lineup of his contemporaries so I didn t even buy that this dude who has spent half of his life in limbo was some kind of expert The title character s entire life and family are so difficult to relate to that I immediately hated her She grew up in a house that has books written about it irritating architecture reference and everyone must dress for dinner at her parents house as if this were a Bront novel Her family employ five black servants In a Christmas scene for which the servants are unchained from the stove and allowed into the dining room the cook actually toasts to Miz Abshire This book was written in How can the Mammy have any place here She isn t even the only racially stereotyped character in this book The traveler s childhood downstairs neighbor a grandmotherly woman he refers to as Kimmy speaks in a broken English which could have been stolen directly from a hateful gold rush-era cartoon The book skips back and forth between the point-of-view of the title character and the time-traveler himself but there is absolutely no difference in their voices I think I actually got confused a few times about who was speaking The phrase she was pale under her makeup was used three times The chapters dealing with infertility were completely unoriginal boring and emotionally flat Not only are conversations unnecessarily long but they are often followed by page after page of internal dialogue as the characters rehash and analyze every point of said conversation Sorry this was so long but this might be the worst book I ve ever read and I m really confused by all the good reviews more"
"2","The time traveler's wife"," Liz S","it was ok"," I recently read The Time-Traveler s Wife and was pretty disappointed---the author somehow manages to turn such an awesome premise the dude actually time travels into something pretty flat and dull The first hundred pages really hooked me but after a while I started to get irritated by All the name checking of hipster-approved bands in an attempt to establish Henry s supposed punk cred He liked the Violent Femmes in That s why he s so badass Seriously The food porny descriptions of the meals they eat Some paragraphs read like the menu of a pretentious bistro The awful ethnic stereotypes that characterize the few non-white characters Nell the mammy-esque family cook complete with dialect or Charisse the childlike Filipina The fact that everyone is successful and at least upper middle class if not fabulously wealthy Even Henry somehow manages to keep his job at the Newberry library for years despite his habits of disappearing for odd stretches of time not keeping appointments and oh running around naked in the stacks from time to time It would have been more interesting to me if his disorder kept him from having any normal kind of professional life The lack of character development in the protagonists after they finally meet as adults All of a sudden they meet and they re in love The author gives lip service to Henry s womanizing and drug problems but really they don t seem to pose much more than a passing problem for Clare because she already knows they ll get married And even as a married couple their biggest source of conflict whether they can or should have a child is extrinsic rather than intrinsic to their personalities characters Clare never really seems to be bothered by her lack of independence or the fact that she s so tethered to Henry because he had a part in making her who she is etc By the time I actually got to the end of the story I was too emotionally distanced from the characters to really be moved by what happens to them---the burden of plot winds up outsripping any kind of nuanced characterization Bad science fiction and bad romance Bah humbug more"
"3","The time traveler's wife"," Danielle","did not like it"," Why can t there be a negative star rating I hated hated this book And yes I did finish it All way-too-many pages of it But in my defense it was foolishly the only book I brought with me when I was hospitalized for hours after wisdom tooth surgery and when your options are daytime soaps or this wretched book well at least I got to read the ending and conclude definitively that it wasn t worth it Okay now that I ve gotten a bit of a rant out let me be a little more organized about my dislikes The sex More accurately the sex after sex after sex in graphic detail not pornographic detail granted but WAY more than I wanted to picture at all sorts of different ages Wow Yeah I just hated that If it serves a purpose to the plot fine include it but don t give me every single move I just don t need to know that The plot was convoluted I can say this fairly because I read it in practically one sitting and while I was able to keep things straight it would have served the book better to not attempt to take in so many sub-plots and minutia Okay I will admit that for having a sci-fi premise the concept of time travel as outlined here was at least moderately believable What I didn t like was that it wasn t especially original anyone seen Journeyman yet had the pretension that it was The whole crux of the novel was the great love story between Henry and Claire Yet as a reader I m much more interested and moved by two NICE people ending up together and staying together than two people I just don t like that much Let s face it Henry is not a great guy And there s that whole poor-rich-girl thing going on with Claire I just wasn t feeling it Okay all of that said I really don t recommend this book to anyone I realize there are a lot of people that like it I know I checked the reviews expecting to be completely vindicated but alas it seems I m in the minority but those people who like it apparently enjoy a different class of book than I do There are so many great works out there why waste your time with this more"

"5","The time traveler's wife"," Erin",""," i hate reading books that everyone keeps bothering me to read first there are the gushing reviews from the media complete with intelligent sound clips it s so awesome so titillating the way the author captures that thing where the girl says that stuff and then they go to that cool place you know even oprah says so and then there are the crowds of friends who carry around their freshly bought it book ok i m bitter i can t afford to buy new books who can t wait to share their newfound genius at having read said new it book they want to tell you ooh but erin hasn t read it yet has she ugh well we ll just have to discuss later then SIGH have you read it yet have you read it yet have you read it yet have you---OW OW being the moment i use aforementioned freshly purchased it book to smack someone over the head thus ending my brief first and last encounter with said book forever unless it wins a nobel prize and i m required to read it for sake of my intelligence which has NEVER HAPPENED spoiler alert HOWEVER sorry this all caps thing is growing on me however a used copy of the time travelers wife was the biggest book i could find in the bargin bin before i boarded my hour flight back to the east coast this holiday season and therefore i found myself starting a novel that s been beaten over my head by all my bffs since it came out and let me tell you small cabin space and an a measly in-flight movie selection of the game plan and george lopez s shitty sitcom whatever it s called were the only things keeping me from dropping my interest throughout the first couple of chapters i wanted to like these characters because i like time travel and anyone who gets to try it out should definitely also be cool but i kept wondering when does it get good when does it get good when does it get---and i m not sure when it happened but suddenly it got GOOD i mean really good it wasn t really enough for me just wondering when claire and henry would get together because to be honest i wasn t that invested in their characters i can t explain this because i can t pinpoint the reason the quality of writing was decent i can find no specific thread to rant on about the characters not being developed there was just no hook after the first tiny intro at the very very beginning i kept waiting for that sense of urgency to come back and then it did suddenly beautifully there was so much for them to live for and as soon as i got that lovely dreadful inkling that henry was going to die of COURSE he has to die shut up i didn t spoil anything this is a love story then i couldn t get enough i think the build up of flash backs helped incredibly in this as well because after i had gained this huge database of memories i was inexplicably and wonderfully tied up in the drama of their stories it was a slow eventual build but the payoff was WELL there s that caps button again god it s fun worth it which let me tell you almost never happens in these cases unless you write a million little pieces and oprah shoves her big foot in her mouth and people like me get to watch the spectle on cnn between episodes of arrested developement lovely ps in a random non funny tangent i would also like to briefly comment on the fact that she wouldn t give up having her all important baby wow annoying i felt just as tired as henry give it up woman you re wasting precious time with him and exhausting everybody on your insane quest don t get me wrong i felt really bad for her during the first part but SIX miscarriages i know there s an element like who could handle that much sadness but i got to thinking who could bring that much death on themselves where is the point where you say it s not going to work and i ll accept that i was frustrated because i felt like she was spending what little time she had with henry making him worried about everything when they could have just been living there done DONE wooooooo more"
"6","The time traveler's wife"," Shan B","did not like it"," Let me start this by saying I was very excited to read this book I thought it was going to be good It is not in any way good It could have been good the idea could have soared but in Niffenegger s hands it was destroyed by laundry lists of grocery bag contents street directions and punk bands until I even said out loud more than once okay I get it He bought groceries he knows how to get around in Chicago Clare likes to clean her studio he is not just a punk rock poser but the real deal complete with his cherry red Docs etc Seriously this stuff does not pass for good writing in any circles The tedious minutae of life is boring and makes the author look like she is trying to pad her story for more bulk The worst part of this book was that the whole thing was based on contrived plot devices The whole time I was reading I was wondering why the author chose to have him time travel naked To me it seemed like if it weren t for his constant pursuit of clothes there may be some real chance at something actually happening in the story Then at the end of the book I realized that the whole naked thing was a tool to achieve the amputations at the end Where was this woman s editor How do things like this get published this story was nowhere near polished and pared down enough to make it to publication Also the gory miscarriage scenes yuck There was no introspect into the character s hearts and minds How does Henry feel about knowing when he is going to die How does Clare deal with him being a time travel We will never know because the book was too full of what they did and how they did it and nothing about how they felt I don t care about that stuff These characters were selfish pretentious and self absorbed And the credibility goes right out the window when they win the lottery Come on I honestly don t see why this book is so well loved This book angered me more"
"7","The time traveler's wife"," Crumb","it was amazing"," I ve been putting off writing this review for days because I knew that this would be a struggle for me There aren t enough words in the English language that could accurately convey my feelings for The Time Traveler s Wife If you haven t read this book I urge you to do so You can expect a literary experience unlike one you ve ever had What did I love most about this book The love story It was truly enchanting The two protagonists Henry and Clare were not only meant for each other but it was as if they were destined to be together They will go on to face obstacle upon obstacle but their love for one another never wanes Simply put this was a book that had that Extra Something The X factor or the IT factor if you will C est magnifique more"
"8","The time traveler's wife"," Lara","really liked it"," I am conflicted about this book Do not let my stars fool you they are an emotional rating I ll start with the things I really liked about it Loved all the foreshadowing The knowing something was going to happen and maybe even a little bit of what it was but never knowing or understanding fully until both characters had experienced the moment And then all the foreshadowing of the tragic end Once I started putting the puzzle together I really couldn t put it down And I had several moments where I couldn t control the tears even long before the tragedy happens because the foreshadowing was that emotionally charged I felt that the way the author set it up was ingenious While you are reading along in a fairly chronological timeline it is interspersed with moments of past and future as Henry travels through time At first it felt very disjunct but by the end I really loved the way it mirrored how Henry and Clare must feel as they lived their life in such a non-chronological manner Especially Henry The love story was indeed epic I bawled like a baby at the end it was so tragic to me And sweet at the same time The way that the author addressed themes of love fate destiny personal choice and of course time was mind blowing at times as all time travel issues are to me but very cool to see how it all intertwined I liked how she dealt with the whole time travel issue in that Henry could never actually change anything in the future Everything already happened whether in the past or the future because for Henry his future is his past and his past is his future I told you it was a bit mind blowing But yeah the love story was riveting Things I didn t like so much The absolutely uneccesary detail of the mundane I felt the author spent too much time describing grocery lists literally of things and music and whatever when she could have been examining the thoughts and feelings of the characters It took me weeks to read this book and not because it was long I didn t have any problem ignoring it for days at a time because of the tedious reading at times Nothing in the writing made me want to keep reading until the last half of the book which I did read much more quickly The language F-word on nearly every page Two sitings of the C-word Totally unnecessary The love scenes were often a bit graphic and there were so many of them Because of this I started feeling that the love was based in sex more than anything and I would have like the author to explore some of the more deep feelings that did show up when Henry and Clare weren t in bed Again unnecessary really Sometimes I got confused and experienced deja vu Knowing it was because one of the characters had already mentioned a certain event and I would often have to go through the book and find the previous mention so I could have full understanding Mostly though it was a very cool book And very emotional at least for me It really spoke to something in me about relationships and choices and destiny not that I totally believe in destiny but you know p more"
"9","The time traveler's wife"," Julie","it was amazing"," This is my th book review for Goodreads Wow I am either one sick or one inspired woman or both Apparently when I reach my th review Goodreads will put a little encouraging button on my profile they might as well just give me a bookmark but feels big too so I wanted to review a book that I love but have never reviewed here The Time Traveler s Wife is a controversial novel and when my book club discussed it there were burning pitchforks buckets of hot tar and glasses of Pinot Noir being splashed in faces The room was like a parking lot after a football game between contentious rivals It was awesome I give a HUGE amount of credit to the ladies of my book club For years they have suffered through having me both a Lit teacher and a writer as a member and they have put up with A LOT of my empassioned opinions When I don t like a book I make it ABUNDANTLY clear why it sucks and when I love a book that others don t I verbally knock them out of my way And I love this book Boy howdy do I love this book I originally read it years ago then re-read it and took a bunch of notes and the characters and the plot just hopped on into the synapses of my brain curled up there and have remained comfortably in that position forevermore In my opinion you can read this book for its surface value as a romance or an adventure or you can go deeper This novel is loaded with metaphors and you can get both Biblical here and or follow the story with Homer s Odyssey by your side For Henry is a modern day Odysseus He s a Christ-figure as well He represents the spring the adventurer the one who is both sacrificed and reborn And his love Clare is both the archetypal mother and the wife the perpetual autumn and Penelope the one who waits Niffenegger s plot point of time travel is immense It serves here as a lush metaphor for the cycle of life the living the dying the what comes after And it doesn t hurt that Henry loves my kind of music too The ladies of book club who passionately disliked this book cited several reasons They complained that Niffenegger s style was not linear they had a hard time following the plot and they found Henry s relationship with Clare bordering on predatory or creepy I acknowledge that they experienced these problems but they just weren t an issue for me And the ending my God I cried to the point of embarrassment even though I was home alone as I finished I actually GASPED at the end and my steadfast rule is if a book makes me GASP it automatically earns stars It is truly one of the best most heart-breaking endings to a novel that I ve ever encountered My sweatshirt was soaked by the end and I ached and mourned and grieved all over those final pages I actually started to cry while writing this review just revisiting that ending A decade later Damn Good choice for my th review more"
"10","The time traveler's wife"," Jim Fonseca",""," Very unusual for me but DNF so I did not give it a rating It s the story of a couple in love where the man comes back at various ages before and after he initially met his wife When that happens we get the perspective on what s going on from both him and her I m not a fan of romance or sci fi so I guess the combination of the two turned me off I always give a book at least pages and this one had so many good reviews I went back and gave it another twenty pages but just couldn t get into it image from astronomytrek com more"
"11","The time traveler's wife"," Claire Greene","really liked it"," This review has been hidden because it contains spoilers To view it click here I have a serious love hate relationship with this book The good stuff I really liked the jumps back and forth in time - surprisingly the author was able to keep it all straight and I never really felt so terribly confused that I just wanted to give up I loved the Henry character I really loved him He was flawed he tried so hard to be a good man etc etc I just really loved this character I liked the love story - I felt that the feelings between the two of them were real and so deep So oft I have a serious love hate relationship with this book The good stuff I really liked the jumps back and forth in time - surprisingly the author was able to keep it all straight and I never really felt so terribly confused that I just wanted to give up I loved the Henry character I really loved him He was flawed he tried so hard to be a good man etc etc I just really loved this character I liked the love story - I felt that the feelings between the two of them were real and so deep So often a love story goes for huge dramatics to prove the deep love between two people and I liked that she didn t do that - you see their love for each other in what they do how they talk how they touch I liked how the author kept the time traveling dark - the idea that he has no money and no clothes and has to scramble to stay alive and not arrested etc etc was great - very realistic for an unreal premise I actually liked that they threw in the genetic testing and whatever of the time traveling disorder I know many people felt that it was ridiculous or felt like it was just shoved in there but I really thought it brought a realism to the story It helped take the story out of the sci-fi realm and put it more in reality All of a sudden it became about a person with a disease and a family fighting to hold it together rather than a mysterious hole in the universe I don t normally like pseudo science but I actually thought it worked here The bad stuff I hated the name dropping etc I know some people liked it but I just hated it Yeah I get it - he liked punk music Wow It just felt so contrived and fake to me It felt more like the AUTHOR likes punk music and art and architecture and whatever else and was putting in those names as a shout out to her peeps Like hey guys if you know who this is you are part of a super secret cool club - yeah Not so much I thought the Claire character was criminally flat I agree with another reviewer that said the book was called The Time Traveler s WIFE and yet she is mostly a non-character Now I don t have a problem with the idea that she ended up devoting her life to Henry That her commitment to him overshadowed other choices she could have made in life - well I thought that was pretty realistic and understandable If her husband got in a car crash and was a vegetable for the rest of his life and to take care of him she ended up having to forgo many choices and let her life be dictated by this man and his medical needs we wouldn t be arguing as much about it But that doesn t mean she doesn t have her own dreams thoughts needs desires etc which the author could have spent more time dealing with and developing I really felt that Claire was mainly there as an object for Henry to love - not her own person You never feel that Claire loved Henry and made this choice this sacrifice - you feel that it was inevitable because the author said so Claire s family was ridiculously flat If Claire was not developed enough her family wasn t developed at all They are pretty much cardboard cut outs of stereotypes propped up at certain points in the story to help keep the plot going And where the heck do they live again that EVERYONE has money Not just money but Money I got sick and tired of the pregnancies and miscarriages How many times before you realize you are harming yourself and your husband to the point that you will never recover Given what happens to him and all - aren t their lives hard enough Why do that to yourselves over and over I understand the strong desire for a child but why not adopt Why was that not an option I can t remember at that point if they knew it was a genetic disorder or not - but if they did would they really want that for their child - wouldn t that be even more of a reason to adopt And what the heck were they going to tell that child Given how talky the characters were I was pretty surprised that there were no heartfelt discussions of how exactly they were going to raise a child in that type of environment and what they would tell other people etc I really didn t like the abrupt cut from the grief on Henry dying to her being That is a lot of time to cover and it felt cheap to not give even a token synopsis of how her and her daughter dealt with his death and her having the same disorder I honestly can t decide whether her being able to see him one last time it was him as a younger man jumping way ahead in time so it was the past for Henry who was still dead was touching or cruel To deal with a devastating loss like that and so much time has gone by and to just have him pop back in like that - are you glad for one more precious moment or is it terribly cruel to give hope and snatch it away And to do that to the daughter too I don t know My feelings about the ending depend on my mood Somedays I feel that the ending was depressing but realistic Not everything has a happy ending and I hate it when movies and TV show that ANY problem can be solved in minutes So having something real even if difficult felt right Other days I feel like it was crap Sure life isn t always great but it isn t always crap either And I hate fatalism like that - I hate the idea that life is crap and there is no escaping it I was also annoyed with Henry quitting - just giving up on life for so long after the feet thing I get that he was depressed and all I do But he has lived his whole life not being able to depend on anything - not where he will wake up not if he ll have money not be able to see or be with the people he loves having to be deposited in the middle of no where and scramble for clothes food and money with no idea when and where he will return This is a man who is incredibly resourceful and resilient I just had a hard time believing that he would quit like that Then again I would imagine all those years of doing just that would take a toll on him and that was the final blow he just couldn t handle But no I still think it was out of character And the truly terribleThe two things that are just atrocious in this book - the references to her families black servants and Henry s friend and downstairs neighbor growing up Kimmy Wow Holy Stereotypes batman Even given Claire s family having money and being upper crust and all - the whole description of them and the black servants was so odd and anachronistic Wait - when did we all time travel to Why is Mammy here And with Henry s downstairs neighbor - she was slightly better written and I enjoyed her character in relation to Henry and all but again she was so stereotypical with the broken en-ga-rish and all I don t know how she got away with those representations at all - how did not one editor or something say uh Audrey could we talk about these ethnic characters They might be a little too ethnic Seriously Absurd So that is it- I loved parts of this book and hated parts of this book There was a lot that was well done and some that was criminal I don t know if I wish someone else had taken this idea and written it or if I wish the author had held onto this idea until she had more books under her belt and could do it justice Either way I just can t truly recommend this book but I can t tell people to avoid it either AARGH more"

"13","The time traveler's wife"," Laura","it was ok"," Just because something is popular does not mean it s good Mass taste is often incredibly bad Such is the case with this book only it s not incredibly bad just not worth the hours it takes to read it It seems like every fiction book I ve read in the past couple of years is highly depressing this one included My life is full enough of it s own challenges and disappointments that I d like to read to escape Yes if novels are full of heartache and struggle they are realistic and more accurately reflecting real life Well this book is clearly not realistic anyway and the amount of trauma that happened to Henry went beyond what an average person encounters I appreciate what Niffenegger was trying to do and it certainly has it s romanticism but it was not enjoyable to read At the beginning I had a hard time getting past the ridiculousness of the time traveling man that is the main premise of the book I compared it to the annoying short-lived tv show Journeyman the also depressing movie Premonition and the time-traveling bits in Lost To better swallow it I thought of it as a children s book for adults So I finally got past the goofiness of time-travelin Henry It was interesting how the author put together all the different past and futures I thought she did a good job with how she chose to order them in the book Where was the plot though While this is not a traditional story in its presentation if you put the different scenes in sequential order it should be Instead of a story with much of a plot though it was more like an anthropological ethnographic study of Clare and Henry One third of the book was just them having sex and making coffee It read to me as more of a descriptive chronicle than a tale with messages to relay I also thought that Niffenegger never fully developed certain pieces like what happened to Henry s dad after Henry visited him and he was barely holding it together Later in the book he comes across as a typical mostly functioning father but we don t see how that change occurred It also isn t clear why Henry likes Gomez It must be nice for Henry to have a friend who knows his secret and Gomez does some stuff to help out Henry and Clare but why the bond The first time they all have dinner together Gomez is highly rude to Henry but then the next time they meet during one of the time travels they re all buddy-buddy It s not like Henry s just using him for help he actually likes him on some emotional level One would think Gomez being in love with Clare would get in the way of that To wrap this up I also think the author tries too hard to make Clare and Henry cool Clare with her dramatic artsiness and Henry with his incredible scope of book knowledge and languages plus all the stuff about their music tastes I don t think she does a very good job of showing how Henry goes from being the selfish lost young jerk to the caring mature husband It s supposed to be Clare s influence but the process is not really shown There s another huge gap in info that bothers me but it would be a spoiler Hard to believe you could have a spoiler without much plot but there are a couple pieces that are major events in the book All in all interesting concept tying time travel to romance but with real life being trying enough I need something more light-hearted more"
"14","The time traveler's wife"," Emma Miss Print","it was ok"," If I had to define The Time Traveler s Wife by Audrey Niffenegger in two words they would be poignant and excessive two words that also illustrate my mixed feelings about Niffenegger s first novel The Time Traveler s Wife is about many things Obviously time travel is an important feature but this novel is also about librarians artists punk rock and alcoholics It s also about love Henry meets his wife Clare for the first time when he is and Clare is Clare met Henry for the first time when she was six and Henry was Henry is literally a time traveler Henry has a disease a cellular disorder that leaves him unglued in time traveling at random to various points in the past and future of his own life and inexplicably to Clare s childhood Henry cannot hold onto any of his possessions when he time travels no clothes no food no money a fact that often has a disastrous effect on Henry s life Throughout it all Clare is at Henry s side faithfully waiting for him to return to her and their life together Niffenegger alternates viewpoints narrating the story in both Henry s and Clare s voice Despite giving the characters equal narration time Clare remains painfully one-dimensional She is defined by her love for Henry her artistic career and unfortunately little else Thankfully Henry is written much more fully Working as a librarian at the Newberry in his present Henry also has a complex life out of time He is also well-versed in the culture of drugs and drinking Really Henry is a mess in every sense of the word Despite all of his problems though Henry remains redeemable Throughout the novel he clings to a certain charm a quality that makes it plausible to believe that Clare really did love him long before Henry first met her The novel jumps from past to present and back again as Niffenegger aptly looks at how Henry s past intersects with his present and his future and his evolving relationship with Clare These examinations are a particular strength of the novel Niffenegger manages to discuss events multiple times without being redundant At the same time she creates a complex storyline without making it impossible to follow Unfortunately she does also falter Most of the novel s shortcomings stem from some kind of excess First and foremost it s too long The hardcover edition runs pages Particularly in the second half of the novel it feels like Niffenegger takes on too much There are too many characters to remember too many events only tangentially relevant to the core plot All things considered the novel could easily have been at least a hundred pages shorter For this reason the premise of the plot has some fundamental flaws points that make no sense in relation to the rest of the narrative On the whole these blips are annoying but not damning especially given the fact that the novel is marketed as general fiction as opposed to science fiction The Time Traveler s Wife also veers dangerously close to melodrama raining biblically disastrous situations on both Henry and Clare Given the ending of the novel one would think that merely being a time traveler would be enough bad luck to last both of their lifetimes Aside from being plain old mean this focus on events makes it difficult to develop the characters Many interesting people walk in and out of Henry s life but few of them are adequately utilized in the book The scope of the narrative is vast and strongly cinematic which leads me to two conclusions One is that this story might have been better had someone else written it The other is that the upcoming film adaptation will be better than the novel Given the fascinating story and characters here hopefully that will be the case You can find this review and more on my blog Miss Print more"
"15","The time traveler's wife"," April","it was amazing"," I adore this book I love it with all my heart The first few pages were a delight a surprise and from then on it was a sweet love affair I wanted both to have read the book all at once and also to have it all yet unread so I could savor it I simply didn t want it to end The story is about two people the time traveler and his wife On the surface they are like any two people who love each other in modern times except for the fact that he travels through time You d think that fact would make this science fiction but this is more a romance -- actually more a great love story than anything A love that transcends time While the science fiction part of it IS interesting it really is all about the couple Henry and Clare Henry s ability to time travel almost becomes a metaphor For what Whatever it is a reader wishes to imagine But there d be no story without it as it s very intricately woven into the romance It s unlikely they ever would have met and come together without it Henry and Clare both tell the story in their first person points of view in the present tense to indicate the here and now though the scenes might be all at once the past the present and the future They take turns not only in telling the story but in knowing what s to come So the story unfolds like a flower with each scene a petal of rosy revelation where you see both sides -- first the outside then the inside -- as it blooms and shows yet another petal within ready to unfurl The plotting is amazing Things that happened in one s past halfway mentioned become a foreshadowing of what s to come for another and in the end things just fall into place bad or good you know that whatever just happened was supposed to happen You can t really worry about the paradoxes though You just have to let go of the feeling that something might never have happened were it not for one thing or another However tangled up the cause and effect become the whole thing seemed fated and comes full circle I suspect that this book inspired the TV series Journeyman which I also love However they have made it light years easier for the time traveler in Journeyman When Henry time travels he brings nothing with him He can t Anything that isn t a part of his body is left behind so he arrives naked and must steal clothes and shoes When the man in Journeyman travels he takes with him whatever he is wearing or holding so he has his clothes and his cash When Henry time travels he is unable to change anything that for him has already happened When the Journeyman time travels it is expressly so he can go back and change the past and when he returns to his present things are not quite what they were when he left And even though the science fiction part of this book is actually fairly understated Henry s version of time travel seems much more real to me more plausible His life with Clare makes it even more so because we see how it affects the two of them and their relationship with each other and with other people Only the media seems left out of it and I think that if Henry s ability was real it would be very much in the media in one form or another I really wish I could articulate everything that I love about this book but I think the best way to share what I m feeling for the book right now is to recommend it to everyone I know Hints of Lolita again but sweeter and more innocent Finished reading March more"
"16","The time traveler's wife"," Jonathan Ashleigh","really liked it"," For whatever reason when I stared reading The Time Taveler s Wife I was in possession of two copies I opted to leave a copy at work and the other at home and I read at least a few pages everyday This meant that each time I picked up the book I was slightly lost and wondering were I was while I searched to find my place within the pages One copy was older and more worn than the other with writing in the margins and creased corners The other book was brand new and living in the present Even with the time lost searching for my place this book turned into a quick read The premise behind it was a great idea and while the author demanded a lot of faith from the reader it was fun to get into the story Even with all the questions surrounding the strange affliction attributed to the main character I cared for the characters and worried about their destiny more"
"17","The time traveler's wife"," Morgan","really liked it"," Rating this was really hard because I really liked it really really liked it but I have such qualms with the ending which could very possibly be a testament to Niffenegger s writing I m not sure Anyway There were several things I wanted to talk about while I was reading it more or less having to do with the notion of time-travel in the book Obviously there s always the immediate connection between Henry DeTamble and Billy Pilgrim both of which are unstuck in time Henry because of a bizarre disorder and Billy because of an existential break-down possibly hightened by Post Traumatic Shock Syndrome I believe that s what it s technically called but don t quote me this is also a literary theory I find to be too easy of an excuse But also I found parallels between TTW and Octavia Butler s Kindred the story of a black woman pulled back through time by one of her ancestors a white slaveholder to the period before the Civil War The interesting thing I found about both of these are the link between Dana and Rufus in Kindred that defies time and space and an almost identical link between Henry and young Clare as an agenda to look at the concept of soul mates This then creates an ontological question concerning the nature of free-will and destiny as Niffenegger herself states numerous times that Henry believes in free-will to a point in that he s free to do whatever or so he believes but because he is so immeshed in time what happens between him and Clare is more destiny they are free to do what they will but they ll always end up where they are meant to be type thing Another aspect that struck me was the idea of time being a biological construct which was like holy shit rock on Because time itself is little more than our perception of change and cause-and-effect and the physical concept of space-time is nonlinear that all time happens right now and it will always happen at any given moment not so much circular as it is ever-present But the notion that time itself can be a flux in our biological make-up was STUNNING If I were a little more awake maybe I could expound a little more about why that interested me so much But to that effect it did bother me a little that Niffenegger told her story more or less linearally despite the constant jumping back and forth that Henry undergoes I almost wish the whole thing was like that with very little linear telling which of course would be problematic with Clare s perception of events hmmm IF YOU HAVEN T READ THE BOOK AND YOU PLAN ON READING IT PLEASE STOP READING THIS REVIEW HERE I DON T WANT TO RUIN THE ENDING FOR YOU This was one of the saddest books I ve ever read aside from Where the Red Fern Grows but what I didn t like was that there was no real time to devote to being sad and crying over Henry s fate destiny end because the story kept going no moment to allow the reader a bit of catharsis And this probably wouldn t have been so bad if Henry hadn t lost his feet and could do nothing else but wait for his final moment I felt that Henry was such a dynamic character and that he would have been one of those types of people who burn out instead of fade away if he were a real person but in the narrative he s not given that chance When he flashes back to that morning at the Meadow I wanted him to be running when he s shot not simply appearing getting shot and returning to the New Year s party And the story kept going after Which granted it is actually more of Clare s story she is of course the time-traveler s wife and gets the first and final words of the story and this does illuminate Henry s ever-present being in time and space And then maybe he s not so much fading away as he is always existing I don t know I have mixed feelings about it more"
"18","The time traveler's wife"," James","liked it"," stars to Audrey Niffenegger s novel The Time Traveler s Wife published in and later made into a movie This one is a hard book for me to rate There was so many great things in it but there was also a lot that made me step away and think about how it all happened Overview A young couple are constantly ravaged by the husband s ability to move between time periods but rarely in a controlled way They are stuck in a haphazard relationship never knowing when he may just disappear for months at a time As a result readers put the pieces of their love story together chapter by chapter knowing the conclusion to some things before you find out how it happened What I Liked The entire concept of moving around throughout someone s life not knowing what time period it is until a few things happen This created a lot of suspense and drama which for the most part worked significantly well however on a few occasions it pushed me over the limit of confusion It s a heart-breaking tale of what happens to a young couple who very much want to be together in love and share a lifetime of orderly memories Note I said orderly memories The images created are quite wonderful With words being the tool to convey the emotion of something none of us have ever been through it s especially important to have strong visuals This was successful on most occasions And when it wasn t I didn t dislike it just wasn t anything special It was unique hardly ever if ever done before in such a way or manner The author should be praised for it What I Didn t Like The concept was too complicated I kept stopping to think if the author built the scene correctly I naturally doubted it assumed there was a mistake in the time sequence Maybe that says more about me being a Doubter than it does about the book OK maybe I should stop here on this item Some of the passages were included purely for humor and the effects on other people of his time travel were a bit too much I m good with someone getting beat up or some silly naked embarrassment but it felt too contrived and one-sided I wasn t happy with the ending and that s all I say Now What You really should read it and then watch the movie It s a different way of handling the story so that s why I suggest both Ultimately it s the kind of book where you think you love it but then things start falling apart in your mind about the gaps and the confusion and you feel like you had part of a story not the whole thing But this is one you need to check out for yourself Just go in knowing it s not a brilliant and perfect piece of literature Still a good story and possibly a bit higher than a on my scale but I m sticking with the rating About Me For those new to me or my reviews here s the scoop I read A LOT I write A LOT And now I blog A LOT First the book review goes on Goodreads and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at https thisismytruthnow com where you ll also find TV Film reviews the revealing and introspective Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I ve visited all over the world And you can find all my social media profiles to get the details on the who what when where and my pictures Leave a comment and let me know what you think Vote in the poll and ratings Thanks for stopping by Note All written content is my original creation and copyrighted to me but the graphics and images were linked from other sites and belong to them Many thanks to their original creators polldaddy poll polldaddy poll more"

"21","The time traveler's wife"," Becky","did not like it"," I am not a romance reader by nature That s not to say that I don t enjoy them from time to time but I just don t usually gravitate toward romance And to be completely honest I had absolutely zero intention of reading this book ever But then it was chosen as my October Bookclub book so my intentions just became irrelevant So now that I ve read it Umm Well I think that this book did have an interesting premise and in another author s hands could have been fantastic But most of the time while reading this I just kept feeling well manipulated and skeptical All I kept thinking as I read this was how implausible it all was And I m not just talking about the time-travel Just to forewarn you this long really long Ranty McRanter Review may contain spoilery stuff This book s description says this is the remarkable story of Henry DeTamble a dashing adventuresome librarian who travels involuntarily through time and Clare Abshire an artist whose life takes a natural sequential course Henry and Clare s passionate love affair endures across a sea of time and captures the two lovers in an impossibly romantic trap Uh huh Impossibly romantic trap Well A trap of some kind anyway My biggest issue here is that Clare s life has been entirely determined by Henry with a little help from his unknown ally the Catholic Church Henry s told her what her life is and will be She will be his wife And because of her Catholic upbringing the concept of predestination is not at all foreign to her remember God has a plan for us all and so she accepts it as a matter of course She sees him as her closest friend the person who knows the most about her in the world the person who loves her the most in the world and as a young girl who is just starting to form ideas about romantic love I d imagine that to her he s like a God An all-knowing he knows her future but mysterious because he won t tell her about it or anything about himself unconditionally loving I don t think I need to explain this one metaphysical or supernatural being time traveler remember and who is just waiting for her to accept him well actually just to get old enough to do so I don t think it s much of a stretch honestly So leaving aside the paradox of their relationship technically being impossible they only meet in the present because of Henry telling her where they will while visiting Clare in the past it strikes me as incredibly unfair to Clare that from years old when she meets a naked man claiming to be a time traveler in the meadow near her house her life becomes tethered to Henry Now I can see a year old accepting a story of a time traveler A year old s imagination is a wild thing and children can accept and cope with concepts that would drive adults to drink But as Clare gets older and learns more about her life with Henry - that they are married specifically - it becomes less and less plausible to me that someone would be able to accept that How does she know that he s not lying to her or manipulating her into the life he claims she will live with him She doesn t know anything at all about him other than the fact that he shows up naked in her yard repeatedly and claims to be her husband in the future To me the time travel itself isn t enough evidence He could be a time traveler AND a liar It just seems to me like a waste A waste of a life that Clare could have had that would have been fulfilling and satisfying without Henry in it Considering the fleeting nature of their relationship and the massive extent of time she spent waiting for him I just don t think it was worth it and to me Henry is incredibly selfish for pursuing that life for her The waiting is just endless And here s where it gets confusing because Henry believes that the past can t be changed to affect the future right So year old Henry meeting year old Clare in the past leads to year old Henry meeting year old Clare in the present It s destined because year old Henry s past contains that meeting at Right But Henry s theory is kind of crap because the whole thing is a paradox He went to a past from a future that couldn t have existed UNLESS he changed the past in order to affect the future And this is another reason why this book felt manipulate-y I feel like we re not supposed to examine it in this way and just read it for the love story and the heartbreaking sadness that this time-travel thing causes in the time traveler s wife s life We re supposed to see this as an epic romance We re supposed to see the relationship as the central focus we re supposed to accept this at face value as everyone accepts Henry s time travel and years worth of him gallivanting around naked in the Newberry Library without losing his job which is completely plausible of course and not give it too much thought because if we look too closely we can see there s not much there Henry is described as something of a player by everyone but Clare A cheater a heartbreaker emotionally unavailable yet we never see this Not one time Ingrid who we don t see with Henry in a Clareless present is the bitter devastated ex and whatshername Celia is the one trying to catch Ingrid on the rebound so of course she s going to play up the Henry-the-Dog thing But I don t buy it Pics or it didn t happen as they say If you re going to claim someone s a player you need to back it up - in real life and in fictional time travel stories Show him time travel back and interrupt his younger self mid-affair Then I d believe it Whoops Instead all we see is Henry the Totally Devoted To Clare He loves her more than love ever loved love and therefore they are DESTINED and so it shall be Henry knows what s going to happen and therefore he doesn t even try He just sits back and let s the future come to him Kendrick s going to be his doctor because he is It happens because it has already happened So no need to get all rowdy and make an effort or anything Yawn In fact that s another thing There s absolutely ZERO conflict in this book None Henry gets arrested for indecent exposure on a freeway in Conveniently he disappears before he s booked Want something Take it Something s weird Accepted Family troubles Just introduce your new wife then all tension is gone If there s a snag it s always a momentary one and it always works out in the end UGH Jeez Anyway Where was I Oh yes characters Clare She is Well This is going to be unpopular but Clare is just an older slightly very slightly less annoying version of Bella Swan She has no life other than Henry Her friends become his friends because it s not like he has any of his own Oh wait his old Korean babysitter counts I guess Her life is completely engrossed by his and there s no part of it that is Henryless She s completely devoted to this guy who had to ship in an extra to appear at his own wedding because he s too unreliable to actually be there in present time Just the kind of life every girl dreams of on their big day DOops close but not quite Supposedly Clare s an artist or something Yeah Something like that I guess I live with an artist And the art TAKES OVER EVERYTHING There s art and art supplies and potential art supplies and scribbles and drawings and markers and paint and art just EVERYWHERE It s not a hobby it s a part of the Boy s LIFE This creative need So when Clare is described as making stuff like times in the book complete with step by step directions and an accompanying Create-It-Yourself shopping list for the reader it rings false with me I don t see her as being an artist I see her as being a toy that Henry picks up and plays with when he s around and who sits on the shelf and waits for him to come back and play with her again when he s not around And when it s convenient aka will reinforce the romance like when she sketches Henry Niffenegger sticks her in a studio with some art supplies and calls her an artist That s not character development that s just lazy Oh but wait you say what about the bird sculptures Oh right those how could I forget because they were so massively important to the story that they were mentioned like one time Henry s job is mentioned a bazillion times and Clare s work mentions I could count on one hand Lazy For real The book is called The Time Traveler s WIFE why is there not more about Clare Why is there not more TO Clare And speaking of shopping lists seriously I don t need an entire recipe recitation for each and every meal they eat And the kinds of meals they eat are ridiculous I don t believe that a year old and her punk-rock rebel anarchist roommates are drinking merlot and eating wild mushroom risotto I can t even roll my eyes enough at that shit But that s not even the best I mean Niffenegger s descriptions are insanely long anyway the quality of the light glinting off of this or that dew on the thinger I don t care about at all the texture of the whatchamajig blah blah blah but at one point Henry is unpacking groceries and EVERY SINGLE ITEM is listed before getting to the point of the list a shocker item THERE WERE ITEMS THIRTY-EFFING-TWO I counted Unlike Clare I am not fascinated by celery stalks and cans of creamed corn So I gave approximately of one shit about of the items that were listed before the SHOCKER ITEM Gah Thirty-two Seriously Another thing that really bugged me were the miscarriages There were times that they were written in such a way that I wasn t sure if it was a nightmare of Clare s or reality - I m still not sure but I think it was supposed to be reality I admit to skimming quite a bit so maybe I missed something Blood-soaked sheets and bed and a little tiny fetus breathing its last in her hand What Maybe Niffenegger isn t familiar with the stages of fetal development but lungs are pretty much the last things to develop so that s just weird But then finally FINALLY Clare gets preggers with her husband who is time travelling from the past She cheated on her hubby with her hubby while in bed with her hubby who is sleeping But hey that s OK They are used to being in bed with each other eh year old Henry and year months old Henry elbow nudge Anyway Toward the end of the book there are quite a few events that feel manipulative in order to cause a certain event Henry s feet are important to him This is drilled into the reader time and again He runs because he needs to run when he time travels and lands somewhere buck-naked raising all kinds of suspicions So of course something happens to his feet Not just one which would have had the same effect likely but BOTH For the shock value And to me it was just not necessary at all Because THE EVENT would probably have happened anyway - it happened in an eyeblink And the repercussions from that event are well We re supposed to be crushed I think this book is doing it wrong I won t lie and say that I wasn t affected though but it wasn t because of the characters themselves It was because I imagine myself in the position of losing someone I love and know how heartbroken I d have been But then I get angry because in the goodbye letter he leaves for her the one in which he tells her to live her life and be happy he mentions - just as an aside you know - that he visits her in the far flung future And that leaves her waiting for him again for years How horribly selfish do you have to be to do that to someone Is that a comfort I don t think so I think it s exactly the opposite It s torture to make someone wait in uncertainty for over half their life for one brief momentary visit Such a waste and the more I think about this book the more I find to dislike in it It s not romantic it s depraved Yeah so I could go on like about how the different perspectives were written and how even with the abrupt shift in POV I could never tell who was narrating unless I either checked or got lucky and one was talking directly to the other because there was no difference in character voice at all but the longer I do the more annoyed I get and I have better books I could be reading more"
"22","The time traveler's wife"," Tung","it was ok"," There s a reason I hate Oprah s Book Club and the reason is that I think she does a disservice to the millions of American women who adore her by recommending terrible books Oprah s problem is that rather than directing her legions of fans to classic books or ones destined to become classics with complex plots and fine writing she directs them instead to crap like The Notebook The Notebook and The Time Traveler s Wife belong to the same genre you ve heard the term chick flick These two books are chick books books whose romantic plots and themes are written to appeal to women a device in books and film that do a disservice to the women s rights movement Niffenegger s book revolves around a man who has a genetic disorder that randomly makes him travel backwards and forwards in time He pops into and out of the life of a woman who ends up being his wife The book revolves around the theme that love transcends time and describes how the couple deals with the man s time-traveling problem This book gets some points for an original concept but unfortunately it is atrociously written First it s way too long almost pages Much of the length of the book is due to the author s inclusion of every minute detail she can think of as if an overabundance of detail makes the scene somehow more realistic Secondly there are tons of rants in the book which is really just the author using her characters to voice her own tastes for example a whole scene devoted to punk music and the punk scene as if the author were reliving her youth which adds nothing to the characterizations Thirdly the book is filled with tiresome clich love imageries For example the time traveler wishing to himself that he were home and finding himself in bed with his wife and stating something inane like I m with Clare so I am home I am home So awful the author should be jailed The only reason I don t have this book ranked lower is that the end of the book deals with issues of death and separation and loss that genuinely touched me but that s more me being sentimental than the book s ability to convey strong emotion Read it if you like chick flicks more"

"24","The time traveler's wife"," Annalisa","it was amazing"," I loved this book It s not perfect but it made me feel and think and want It s one of those stories that pulls you into the characters lives and leaves you wanting more mulling over the scenes and premise for days after you ve reluctantly turned the last page Rarely is such an original idea portrayed with such vivid language so you believe the time travel possibility and the characters are almost people you know It s about a guy who involuntarily travels time He can never predict where or when he will jump the time space continuum but when he does he is drawn toward significant events and people in his life The science fiction is a medium for a love story not a cheesy or unrealistic besides time travel which she makes believable one but a deep enduring love in for the long haul of life and hardship told from both his and her perspective and how time travel affects their lives and relationship It starts when Henry meets Claire for the first time and she is ecstatic to finally have found the love of her life in the present Henry must get to know this stranger introduced to him as his future wife and Claire has to nurture him into the man she loves As you relive scenes from Claire s past and Henry s future you see how they fall in love at different times with someone already madly in love with them and conquer the challenge of his disorder Because their relationship is non-chronological you discover events out of order--as do they--making the story interesting and leaving you with the same sense of longing the characters feel I thought the odd age difference Henry playing father figure to the girl who will be his wife was handled well instead of pedophileish as was the delve into both Henry s and Claire s minds and emotions although I wish their voices differed more to get a better grasp of how this condition would affect normal life I really cared about these characters Henry trying to protect Claire and Claire left wanting In one scene she is racing to meet him after a prolonged absence and he fades before she can reach him I felt for her what she had to sacrifice to revolve and dedicate her life to him Some of the minor characters strange and distracting but overall the story is powerful and vivid One is left to question the origin of fate and ethics Does the past affect the future or the future the past Or is it all predestined Claire knows what dates Henry will visit because he gives her the dates he memorized from her diary and told her to write down so he could later memorize them Where did the knowledge originate How would you explain and hide abnormalities What would you consider ethical in playing with time I didn t have a problem with the thievery he transfers nude but I did with using money knowledge from the future There is a lot left to contemplate Be forewarned there s a lot of loving in the story and not just the act but the dirty reference to the deed as well I think Niffenegger must have wanted to steer clear of being too cheesy so she regrettably went too far the other direction Many of the sex scenes are graphically portrayed but there is one scene only hinted at the idea of which almost made me close the book Gratefully the concept didn t linger but unfortunately the language did Gratuitous and unnecessary for the story oh but what a story Update loved the book-to-movie screen adaption They really captured the longing the sense of being guided trapped even by fate Well played too more"

which reminded me a lot of the tv show Charmed one of my secret now not-so-secret indulgences in which Paige orbed out of the car crash which kills both her parents - could Niffenegger be a fan also His time traveling is genetic like an imperfection or flaw in his genetic code He can t control it and it causes more than a few problems in his life When he travels he does so suddenly and turns up in the past or the future completely naked with no idea of where or when he is But he s not completely vulnerable - he taught himself in one of those mind-bending scenes that only make you ask Yes but how did he teach himself how to pick locks pick pockets steal fight run anything necessary to survive until equally suddenly he pops back into the present be it a few minutes or several days since he disappeared This creates not just problems in his social and love life but also in his job - he s a librarian and his colleagues think he has some kind of kinky thing for running around naked in the stacks When he s he meets Clare Abshire for the first time Only she s known him since she was six How He starts time travelling to her past after he s met her in real time It s a disorientating experience for him to be confronted with this beautiful red-haired year old art student who knows a great deal about him - if not his life certainly his personality - and though he doesn t know it yet even lost her virginity to It s a bit disorientating for us too but it s like riding a bike after a while you get the hang of it This is a love story and a tragic one at that Because I like to be optimistic I began reading this in the expectation of a happy ending I didn t get it but that s not really what made me cry I cried because I had invested so much of my own emotions in the characters I had come to care for them to feel for them and hope for them that the ending shattered me I cried for Henry I cried for Clare I cried for their passion so early ended and the loneliness with which Clare must now live with despite the child they managed after miscarriages to have Set in Chicago over several decades up to Niffenegger is obviously in love with her city Despite that I didn t get a strong feeling of Chicago nor a great mental image of it Perhaps because Henry is all over the place and Clare s parents live in a different state or perhaps because the author fails to really get across the true elements of the city which I have never been to I ve read several books lately that kept going long after they should have ended The Lovely Bones for one example Not so here It s a long book at pages that just flew by but in those pages you really get to know Clare and Henry and the characters friends and family and doctors all around them The time travel element is what makes this an ambitious book Keeping track of their lives of the insights and hints and clues divulged in one sequence with when it happens in real time At first I had a sharp eye looking for slip-ups By the end I had to admit I couldn t find any Although some things are never returned to like Henry divulging his secret to Gomez a lawyer in love with Clare but married to her best friend because he will help him out a lot in the future the Henry doing the divulging is from the future and so knew Gomez a lot better than the -year-old Henry Gomez had met just the night before - but this is never returned to there is no more clue as to what kind of legal trouble Henry gets into no trials no arrests Henry is often arrested for things like indecent exposure but always disappears before they can fingerprint him and find out who he is Perhaps it did get a bit melodrammatic toward the end My perception is clouded now I don t want to give too much away so suffice it to say that certain events leading up to the end were so raw and tragic I lost myself to the book completely and went with the flow no longer trying to find slip-ups or inconsistencies or judging the writing style Speaking of which sorry about this review it s all over the place it s written in present tense which works well since the time frame is like this review all over the place One line or description rather that I particularly loved was when Henry from the future and Alba his daughter from the future meet and spend time together in at the beach Tell me a story says Alba leaning against me like cold cooked pasta p like cold cooked pasta - ooh I can feel it That clammy feeling a perfect description for after you ve been swimming In general though Niffenegger s style is not high brow literary I found it easy to read with a good flow excellent pace and those philosophical thoughtful insights and asides you get from a layered writer She made an effort to get the voices right for young Clare and young Henry though Clare s was more convincing than -year-old Henry s Really here I m just trying to get all my thoughts down If they appear a mess and out of order etc then that means my brain will be less so and that works for me Essentially having been lucky enough to find the love of my life the idea of losing him rips my guts apart And since I actually want to invest in fictional characters whether they be in books or in movies etc I felt their pain as well as their love and happiness and all the feelings in between There s a strong story here told by characters who may not be out of the ordinary in any other way but who feel and in feeling live more"

"28","The time traveler's wife"," Johann jobis","really liked it"," Don t you think it s better to be extremely happy for a short while even if you lose it than to be just okay for your whole life The unusual love story of Clare and Henry who met when Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six but got married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry was thirty-one Henry suffers from Chrono-Displacement Disorder wherein his genetic clock will reset and he will find himself traveling through time to both his past and future Henry s time-traveling is unpredictable and spontaneous yet the couple try to live a normal life This book gives me feels Deep deep feels Admittedly I don t read much romance at all but every now and again I will come across a book or even a romantic storyline in a non-romance genre that will just reach into my chest cavity and tug on those heartstrings Clare and Henry s love story is one of those situations The fact that Henry travels through time and yet nearly always seems to find Clare tears up My favourite aspect of their relationship is that they re basically really normal people apart from the whole time-traveling thing of course they have their arguments and disagreements but at the end of it all they re just a couple who are deeply in love I love how double checks spelling Niffenegger tells this story she flips back and forth between Clare and Henry s perspective At the beginning she also moves back and forth in time from Clare and Henry s first meetings when Clare is young to present day Initially the rules of the time travelling can be a little confusing but once you get a grasp on it it flows pretty seamlessly I really like how Niffenegger portrays their relationship she covers quite a lot of the minutiae of their everyday lives seemingly boring events but it weirdly makes you feel like you re also a part of their relationship and I found myself more attached to them for those reasons I finished the book a few days ago now and I STILL miss them I don t have many complaints for this one although the amount of sex can become quite repetitive and makes me want to roll my eyes Now I ain t no prude or anything but it was just a lot at times Overall a really beautiful heartbreaking story that will make you believe in true love and go through an entire box of Kleenex more"
"29","The time traveler's wife"," Amanda","it was ok"," I m finally finished I have several problems with this book many of which were laid out by my friend Liz s brilliant post thanks for lending me this read--I think First of all it s way too long The plot is not so action-packed that it merits pages and hour upon hour of my time Why you ask Because nothing happens There were about pages where Henry just floats back and forth through time Clare is annoying and no plot advancement occurs I mourn the loss of all those trees The second major problem I have with this book is how little you feel for the characters I felt no sense of dread or pain or happiness for them ever Considering the author had pleeeeenty of time to endear Henry and Clare to the reader I never once found myself affected by their strange fates I think part of this is because she keeps them emotionally guarded even though we are in their heads the whole book and also because it s hard to imagine people like them existing in real life much less dating and marrying I mean what is a rich little prim and proper girl like Clare doing living and philandering with communists I know she s an artist but come on Okay one last gripe I am so irked at how the author inserted a snippet of The Odyssey at the end of the book She can t possibly think her book should be considered a classic like that--and even if it s only meant to compare the two stories I hate the deliberateness and pompousness of such an inclusion It s a shame this book wasn t executed better because the idea behind it--how time affects relationships how relationships exist at different phases in our lives and how timing plays into relationships--is brilliant Right now I am just annoyed that I spent so much time slogging through this thing more"
"30","The time traveler's wife"," Bionic Jean","liked it"," The Time Traveller s Wife was published in It was Audrey Niffenegger s first novel and is a surprisingly accomplished feat involving a complicated time structure and alternating first-person perspectives The two main characters Henry and Clare are introduced by way of a Prologue The couple meet in a library in Chicago but while Clare clearly knows Henry very well and has done for a long time Henry does not seem to know who she is He is vaguely dazzled by this luminous creature who insists that she has known him since she was six years old at which time he was Since Clare is now and Henry is this seems a confusing scenario for the reader We gradually come to understand that this is because Henry has been travelling from his future to her past and that in her past they had fallen in love We understand that Henry hasn t actually yet met Clare in his own present Henry therefore is the time traveller and Clare is his eponymous wife This sets a pattern for the rest of the story which largely follows Clare s life but is interspersed with some of Henry s time-travelling adventures Audrey Niffenegger explains that Henry has been born with a genetic dysfunction which she terms chrono-displacement The Time Traveller s Wife is divided into three parts The first Book The Man Out Of Time broadly covers Clare s growing understanding of the unique relationship she is to have with Henry Clare has carefully kept a diary which details all the future dates for Henry s visits and she shows him this on almost their first meeting The obvious result is that Henry feels rather overwhelmed and confused and does not know what to make of it all but also finds himself very attracted to Clare her obvious passion and fervent loyalty It also squares with his own experience and what he knows about himself Henry can remember the first time he time travelled on his fifth birthday He had enjoyed his first visit to a Museum of Natural History in Chicago so much that later on he found that he had suddenly been pulled back there in time to the museum The novel breaks the accepted rules of most time travel books at this point view spoiler by having young Henry meet an older -year-old version of himself The older Henry explains that he is a time traveller but that it is a great secret All through Henry s teenage years the older Henry teaches him various tricks which he will need to know to survive such as stealing breaking and entering and running from the police hide spoiler A major shift in the narrative comes as we next read a description of the event Clare has already referred to We jump to the first time she as a -year-old met the -year-old Henry in a meadow near her family s house on Lake Michigan Henry had called out to Clare from behind a bush where he was trying to conceal his naked self Oddly this apparently rather dubious situation comes across in the story as being rather sweet with a very self-possessed young Clare merely handing Henry her picnic blanket so he can cover himself up The book follows her childhood and teenage years her longing for a physical relationship with the -year-old Henry since she knows that she will be with him in her future We see her growing recognition that her peers think her strange wondering why she is not interested in boys of her own age view spoiler A particularly poignant part of this first section is set at Christmas time Clare has hidden Henry in the reading room of her parents house She knows that Henry hates Christmas because he had told her that was when his mother died On the morning of Christmas Eve when Henry was six years old both he and his mother had been involved in a car accident on their way to pick up his father Henry managed to survive only because he had time travelled Ever since that occasion he had been overcome with guilt for not being able to save his mother s life travelling to the scene of her death over and over again but helpless to do anything except watch the tragedy unfold Henry thinks he should have died then too hide spoiler However the book has many comedic moments since Henry can never take anything with him into the next world not even his clothes Usually he can name the date of his next trip and Clare becomes used to arriving with clothes for him but as the novel progresses there are more of the spontaneous shifts where at any moment Henry finds himself sucked out of the present and thrown naked into another time and place view spoiler One example is when Clare and Henry get married With all their family and friends in attendance Henry is whisked away without warning just before the ceremony But through a coincidence beloved of novelists an older Henry shoots through the years to take his place Oddly only the most observant of guests wonders about his suddenly grizzled appearance hide spoiler The second Book A Drop Of Blood in a Bowl of Milk begins with Henry and Clare s married life which is marked by Henry s frequent absences and Clare s inevitable worries about him view spoiler She has begun to feel trapped and frustrated in their small apartment Of course with the premise of the novel Henry is able to buy a winning lottery ticket which he duly does they move into a larger place where Clare has a studio and can pursue her Art ventures and all is hunky dory again hide spoiler Audrey Niffenegger carefully explores the emotions of the couple and it is interesting to the reader to observe the dynamics of their characters and relationship The time travel element serves to highlight and sometimes resolve any cracks in the relationship There is a point in the novel for instance where Clare is in her thirties and Henry is Their relationship is rather jaded as Clare narrates Henry s been gone for almost hours now and as usual I m torn between thinking obsessively about when and where he might be and being pissed at him for not being here I hear Henry whistling as he comes up the path through the garden into the studio He stomps the snow off his boots and shrugs off his coat He s looking marvellous really happy My heart is racing and I take a wild guess May Yes oh yes Henry scoops me up and swings me around Now I m laughing we re both laughing The reason for this view spoiler as their present selves both know is that Henry has been swept back to the date when he and Clare first made love when Clare was just before once again being pulled back into his present And the recognition of this hide spoiler mends the breach they are both feeling and also serves to demonstrate to the reader a shift or dichotomy within any relationship new or established where one is feeling and experiencing different emotions from the other at any one time This dichotomy then is the crux of the novel One person s story is always going to be slightly different from another s even when they are experiencing the same relationship The novel does have limitations Its focus is really very narrow even though the complexity of the time travel element does mean that the reader tends to give up on carefully following the chronology - the dates heading each chapter - and just go with the flow But these two characters seem to be almost fanatically trying to have the conventional American dream of happy normal domesticity and in the end this begins to pall a little to feel a little tired There is even an attempt in this middle section to give the fantasy element more validity with the introduction of a new character a Dr Kendrick With his assistance Henry s involuntary time travel will later become known as Chrono-Impairment Sadly this plot development leads nowhere view spoiler The doctor says he won t be able to cure him because this newly recognised disorder is too complex to work out and treat during Henry s lifetime The condition does appear to be hereditary which explains Clare s repeated miscarriages The unborn babies seem to time travel which means that Clare s body aborts them There is a way around this however again using the premise of time travel and eventually Henry meets the child Alba whom they will have together in the future He discovers that she has more control over her travels than he does but also learns from her the imminent date of his death hide spoiler There is also a mysterious shooting accident in this part plus a gruesome operation making Henry s ability to time travel very dangerous Neither of these episodes I found terribly convincing The accident seemed to be put in purely for the mystery element - to make the reader wonder at the reason for all the blood to wonder if it was fatal - during a couple of time travel episodes The unconnected medical operation merely seemed rather ludicrous The third Book A Treatise on Longing is possibly the least satisfactory part of the novel view spoiler It describes Clare s life after Henry s death Although a letter from Henry has urged Clare to move on with her life she also learns from it that he had once travelled to her future where he had seen her as an old woman This makes Clare decide to wait for him For many years Alba sees Henry on his visits but he never visits Clare again until she is years old hide spoiler Although with this final section the ending is inevitable and meant to be poignant it comes across as rather sentimental and maudlin Throughout the novel the reader knows that Henry and Clare s lives are already mapped out and the time of their deaths already written This impinges on the fantasy element rather too much In fact it smacks a little of a spiritual religiosity - and one without free will However this is a very ambitious project for a first novel and for much of the novel it translates onto the page with skill an authentic believability and a fair amount of charm If there had been no time travel element this would be a romantic novel perhaps with a psychological focus or a simple family saga The domestic details here are more enjoyable because they add the necessary realism to the fantasy Even though the relationship element is predominant the fascination with the time travel element tends to enhance what might otherwise be a mundane if romantic story Some of it works some does not some is rather mawkish It is very possible that Audrey Niffenegger s best novel is yet to come She has since written another novel Her Fearful Symmetry and a balletic fable for the Royal Opera House Ballet in London in addition to her previous graphic novels She is professor of creative writing at Columbia College Chicago It will be interesting to read the novel she is currently working on The Chinchilla Girl in Exile and to see whether this novelist has grown in stature I won t ever leave you even though you re always leaving me I wanted someone to love who would stay stay and be there always Maybe I m dreaming you Maybe you re dreaming me maybe we only exist in each other s dreams and every morning when we wake up we forget all about each other more"

"35","The time traveler's wife"," F","it was ok"," This story was really cool but it was far too long for what it was I liked the idea of the time travelling and the book started off really good But it either went downhill or I lost interest by the end Didn t really like Henry or Clare I love short chapters in books but this was almost too choppy for me And don t get me started on the dream parts I just wouldn t read them I don t care So many chapters could have been taken out this book with no damage to the storyline"
"36","The time traveler's wife"," Madeline","liked it"," Just in time for the movie release I finally got around to reading this after it d been sitting on my bookshelf for months There s a lot of hype surrounding this book which automatically makes me want to hate it in a very superior way But I can t hate it because frankly I liked reading this Not loved just liked The simplest thing I can say about this story is that it s nice But just for fun I m going to do this review in a style I call The Good The Bad and The Ugly Because then I get to complain and nitpick more The Good Niffenegger say that five times fast gets maximum points for originality plus ten bonus points for writing a book centered on time travel that never makes the readers go cross-eyed from confusion Yes the time travel aspect takes a little getting used to but it didn t leave me nearly as mystified as plot devices like that usually do And while I wish she hadn t felt the need to come up with a scientific explanation as to why Henry time travels genes really I understand why she wanted to make the story as plausible and realistic as possible The Bad the book is a romantic story first and foremost and you have to be in the right mood for that Since I possess a level of cynicism and disillusionment usually reserved for ninety-year-old war veterans schmoopy romances like this are rarely my cup of tea But for the most part it was okay The next thing is a minor nitpick but it s still bugging me at one point in the story Henry describes his former girlfriend as looking like her usual Bond Girl self I wonder how many Bond movies has this author actually seen I d guess the answer is not many but maybe I ve just seen too many Is it just me or does describing someone as looking like a Bond Girl seem way too unspecific I mean think about all the different Bond Girls - they don t all fit into one specific mold Pussy Galore vs Vesper Lynd for instance The Ugly To be perfectly frank I got a little tired of constantly hearing about how mind-blowingly fantastic Henry and Clare s sex life was It seemed like every five pages they were fucking again and Niffenegger almost never says having sex or making love it is always fucking Classy Really Niffenegger we don t need to know all of this stuff You say Clare goes crazy for oral sex How fascinating can we move on now Oh good now Clare is fucking someone else I hope we get a blow-by-blow description and then a tasteful far overdue fade-to-black The author gets credit for keeping Henry and Clare s early relationship relatively not-creepy this was when he was in his forties and time traveling to Clare s childhood but that goes out the window when Clare turns eighteen and Henry visits her as a -year-old This incendentally is the point at which Clare discovers just how much she loves having cunnilingus performed on her Excuse me while I go stand in the corner doing the cootie dance more"
"37","The time traveler's wife"," Joe Valdez","did not like it"," JOE It s a routine evening in November I m reading a novel about time travel because November is Science Fiction Month The novel is The Time Traveler s Wife by Audrey Niffenegger It was a very popular novel made into a very unpopular movie starring Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams Few people went to see the movie and fewer seemed to like what they saw This made me afraid at first but now I think the movie must be better than the novel The author uses very plain language Let me explain The basis of her novel is one of the greatest adventures a couple could possibly experience Time travel The author alternates between the couple CLARE and HENRY who tell their story in first person Like I am Like a script CLARE talks Then HENRY talks It s all very plain Which I don t mind plain I read novels to become engaged in a story Language is a bonus Audrey Niffengger is skilled at neither language or storytelling There s too much telling in this book and not enough story The telling continues on and on Like this long plain paragraph I m writing Clare tells about missing Henry who disappears into thin air to pop up in the past A metaphor for men absent in their relationships Maybe I am not the demographic for this novel Clare suffers and is sad I could care less about Clare Or Henry I like Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams but that s as far as it goes So I am adding this novel to my Abandoned pile If you are a fan of this novel please tell me about your experiences more"
"38","The time traveler's wife"," Hippo dari Hongkong","liked it"," OK to be honest I m having a hard time reviewing this book I had a mixed feeling that sometimes I like this book and sometimes I dislike this book There were moments when I just want to throw this book and moments when I suddenly realized that I m having a hard time putting it down It s difficult to write the review cause somehow I want to tell you everything Henry has chrono-displacement disorder and he will be sucked backs and forth in time mostly when he was stressed He can t control it didn t ask for it and is not exactly happy with it But he learns how to handle it He shows up naked and has to figure out how to survive for however long he is there Sounds sci-fi to you I have never been a fan of sci-fi but I can tell this is not pure sci-fi In my opinion the time travel is just an element background for the story Perhaps some people might be more carried away by the romance and relationship between Henry and Clare The story unfurls through time with first person perspectives from both Henry and Clare The first pages really engaging and intrigued me I remember that I found it a little difficult at first I mean I couldn t keep track of anything cause the time line shifting back and forth rapidly But on the contrary that was the main point that hooked me I eagerly awaited the moment where it would become obvious that Clare and Henry were meant to be together The battle between free will vs fate plays an important role in the story That s was the biggest issue for me that keep me wondering all the time even after I finished the book But then things turned for me at some point midway through the book I don t why but I felt the book suddenly turns out to be so tedious for me that I decided to put it off for a week Too much unnecessary details for me I guess D but then there s something itching in my mind that somehow triggered my curiosity to find out what will happen to Henry So I decided to finished it OK SPOILERS ALERT DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT IF YOU HAVEN T READ THE BOOK OR YOU HAVE PLAN TO READ THIS BOOKAfter finished this book I have so many question dangling in my head Do I like it Do I hate it should I gave two stars or four stars instead of two stars I mean this book sometimes funny shocking boring heartbreaking and disturbing at the same time I don t know whether I m confuse or just stupid The GoodThe non-linear narrative was interesting The idea about love story blended with the time travel adventure are great It make me wondering this question what if constantly I know that certain scene made some people sobbing and bathed in tears Well I admit that I had my moment too D Not the ending part though But the moment when Henry and Claire meet the seven years old Alba I loved her from the future How Alba ran toward Henry and crying in his shoulder and Henry whispered in her ear not to tell Clare that he will be dead soon Henry died when Alba was five years old So I understand how happy Alba and Henry to see each other It s heartbreaking I feel like an ugly giant sap at that scene Ok there I said it Enough about that DThe BadI don t know how I felt about Clare character it seemed to me that she is never given a real chance to have her own life Some of her decisions were made because she knew about the future for example would Clare learn to like coffee if Henry didn t tell her that she already like it in the future and I think Henry and Clare relationship is pretty much built on sex Did I mention that there s so much sex in this book I remember I uttered the F words out loud in the middle of the night when I stumble upon the scene in which Clare had sex with Henry while the present Henry is a asleep next to her I don t know but for me that s just freaking annoying I also found the relationship between the young Clare and the older Henry disturbing For me it was kinda child molestation by an adult male it seemed wrong even though nothing wrong happened between them at least until Clare turns eighteen years old I said whoaaaa at Clare s birthday D more"
"39","The time traveler's wife"," Carol","really liked it"," In this imaginative and unusually written story an unorthodox romance develops between the handsome time-traveling librarian Henry and beautiful artist Clare who struggle to find a way to accept and adjust to their difficult relationship With no conscious control over staying put in the present time or knowledge of where he will end up next the often naked Henry encounters many dangerous and embarrassing moments relives some horrendous occurrences of times past and handles it all with wit and a forthwith manner of acceptance As a huge fan of time travel novels I really enjoyed this story even though I vaguely remember not liking the movie do not recall why more"
"40","The time traveler's wife"," Helene Jeppesen","it was ok"," So As you can see from my rating I m one of those very few people who didn t absolutely love this book I started out reading with an open mind and high expectations because I had heard so many great things about this novel however I finished reading the last pages with an urgency because I wanted for it to end I had quite some problems with this book but let me start with the main one While reading this book I came to a realization about my reading preferences I like for my storylines to be mostly linear because I like to dive into the story and understand things from beginning to end The storyline of The Time Traveler s Wife is obviously not linear because it deals with time traveling and the protagonist Henry can actually travel both forward and backward in time That results in a very messy plot line where you really need to be focused in order to understand the rules to this time traveling and what is going on I spent so much time being confused while reading this book and I wasn t really enjoying myself There is one chapter that stood out to me because it was magical and adorable but I think that s because that s the only long chapter in the book with almost no time traveling We got to actually stick with the period and the characters and actually get to know them and their situation in depth In contrast the rest of the novel was a blur to me with too much shifting in time and space for my taste Furthermore I don t think Audrey Niffenegger does a good job at explaining this time traveling I can t go into spoilers but while the book gradually gave me some answers I m still left with some troubling questions after having finished it To me the time traveling just didn t make sense and that just made me even more frustrated Niffenegger is also very fond of telling the story instead of showing it which is another literary devise that I strongly dislike Some of the telling became too exaggerated for me and decreased my reading experience I saw some things coming that were supposed to be a surprise and I wasn t amused Last but not least I need to mention the one thing that I liked about this story and that is the relationship between Henry and Clare They are adorable together and I wanted to follow their progress but even that was ruined with questions that kept appearing in my head about Clare s tolerance towards Henry s traveling So even though I did find small parts of this book enjoyable I wouldn t recommend it if you know that you like the kind of books that I like more"
"41","The time traveler's wife"," Alyssa","it was amazing"," I will admit I was slightly nervous to pick up this novel I had heard it is very sad which it is and I wasn t sure if I was willing to read something sad However I am very happy I decided to read it anyway because it is an amazing novel It definitely deserves to be a BBC classic novel While I found the writing style and concept to be slightly confusing at first I quickly got the hang of reading it and now think it is very unique and intriguing I loved reading the love story from both the male and female perspective This book definitely deserves five stars and a spot on my favorites shelf more"
"42","The time traveler's wife"," Tatiana","did not like it"," I know this book is very popular and critically acclaimed but I simply couldn t finish it I think I gave it a fair chance - CDs out of it just failed to grab my attention I liked the concept of time travel and structure of the book but it was just too boring for me especially when Clare and Henry finally met in real time I wouldn t advise against reading this book but I personally was bored to tears by it"

"44","The time traveler's wife"," Jen","really liked it"," I married at age twenty a dozen years ago Every year of marriage only confirms that I chose well or was lucky or the fates were smiling upon me whatever and if my married years aren t proof enough there s Facebook as a nice reminder But I remember that at the time of my wedding I didn t really feel like I had a big choice to make There was no nail-biting scenario where a cartoon drawing of myself might have looked pained over having to choose between a heavenly or hellish future drawn in bubbles above my penciled head There was no crossroad of decision there was only forward along a path that wanted walking that I had always been walking Because everything in me wanted to eat sleep breathe next to this other person I don t think that feeling that way is unusual most songs are either about feeling it or not feeling it what is unusual is that I still feel that way I know I know it s a bit embarrassing but it is true And that above all is why I like this book I have to admit that although at first I winced at Clare as a young child being visited by Henry it didn t take me long to get used to reading about it And the reason is that I have often wished that my lover had been there alongside me growing up that he had been there to watch me empty out that whole industrial size bottle of glue on that eighth grade asshole Burton I just never wished that he could watch it high-five me and collapse with laughter over it next to me as an adult I mean as long as I m wishing I might as well wish that he could have seen Burton s face while only four years older than myself There are plenty of negative reviews about this book The time traveling aspect has holes in it arguably It is a fiction book chronicling two people in love and one of them time travels There will be holes Some reviewers didn t like the sex in it- too much Too graphic But life is graphic and sex is graphic and well I guess I am just one of those that doesn t mind a little graphic sex now and then And I feel kind of sorry for those who do mind So sorry so very sorry But there are books for you too Sweet books where two characters are so into each other so drenched in themselves when together that they make tea sit in rockers Hold hands I think they are called inspirational romance but I wouldn t really know I m too busy having sex The only thing negative I have to say about the book is that the ending should have come sooner A clean ending is always nice even when heartbreaking No need to tie things up in pretty bows two people are in love one of them time travels There will be pain Time s a bitch straightforward we all knew reading the book that bouncing back and forth ping-ponging through it would be painful more"
"45","The time traveler's wife"," Hirdesh","it was amazing"," Great book as I d expected after watching the movie Epic writing with twisting way I d just loved it I ve watched no of movies about Time travelling Time machine But this fiction was genuine and flowed with emotions as well righteousness of the Lady character- Clare and his lover The time traveler- Henry"
"46","The time traveler's wife"," Kristy","really liked it"," I wish that this book was a Choose Your Own Adventure so that when Henry starts yapping off at the jib about seventies punk to that high school kid at the Christmas party that you could choose instead of having the kid listen in rapt gratefulness while Henry lists off all the bands this schmuck has to find out about to have the kid kick him square in his unbelievably pretentious punkrocklibrarian balls People like this book I know I threw my credibility out the window when I admitted that I read Jacqueline Susann novels but I do have some taste actually And I can t prove it you can just believe me or not believe me but this book is completely tedious And I like the idea of it and I have nothing against the romance genre but these characters are just completely grating This book is having the same effect on me as a Donna Tartt novel I got all pissed off when I spent valuable hours of my life reading The Secret History as well Also a turd with annoying contrived pretentious characters Does anyone else think Clare is irritating too This Poor Little Rich girl thing is just making her completely unlikeable to me and the description of her life in Chicago and the Aragon and whatever UGH I am going to send Niffeneger my doctor bills from when I had to go to the emergency room to get my eyes to roll back down out of my head It s just SO manipulative that even I I of the Jacqueline Susann novels and the W S Merwin o k I spread it around I go to all the neighborhoods I m not snobby is the thing I just can t abide this I m giving it one more chapter and if it doesn t get better it s going into limbo O K so it s a new day and I ve always been a cat who can admit it when she is partially incorrect about something And my earlier comments about the first part of the novel are pretty true I swear but if you can get through the chick-lit beginning the second half of the book is really interesting and gripping and moving and now I can see why people like this book so much Even the writing gets better it s grainier and she uses these really beautiful and frightening dream sequences to lay out what is happening to her characters emotionally and it is just so GOOD I would almost want to reread it just to find the place where it changes because there is a spot in the book right after they get married I don t remember exactly where when I all of a sudden knew that I was reading a different book I still have a couple of quibbles The thing is and don t read this part if you haven t read the book yet and you don t want it ruined how did he not know that his feet were going to get removed He knew all kinds of stuff why not that Or did he did I just miss that he knew And I didn t understand how the death of Clare s mom fit into the story structure Ingrid and Celia Anyone It just seemed like there was another book sitting on top of the good part of this book Like someone shuffled the pages of two drafts together or something O K so not that I don t have some issues with it but for the most part I retract my earlier statement about the book being bad It s actually really good Just keep reading even when you are sure that it s not going to be what you need it to be because then it changes and it is more"

"48","The time traveler's wife"," Nancy","did not like it"," I gave up reading after pages or so and don t quite know where to begin what I found wrong with the book The characters were flat and I didn t connect with any of them the writing style was dull and while I generally love time travel stories the time travel aspect in The Time Traveler s Wife wasn t that believable to me I would have given up sooner but read so many positive reviews that I had hopes it would get better"
"49","The time traveler's wife"," Annie","liked it"," The time traveller s wife is probably one the rare few books that I read after having already seen the movie But it was on the list and you don t argue with the list My friend and I last year decided to take the challenge to complete the BBC list This is number twenty five On the surface it is the same old boy meets girl girl meets boy they fall in love and then something bad happens La de dah But here s the thing- the boy has a rare genetic affliction that allows him to time travel without any nifty little time machine hidden in a compact guitar case or a DeLorean And it doesn t really allow him so much as make him jump in time and therein lies the problem He cannot control where in time or place he ends up in Also he cannot take anything with him when he jumps So no money no clothes and bye bye identification Poor bugger Audrey writes in style The slow quiet prose was a good addendum to the lull left behind by the holiday season slowly receeding like a fog in my brain Perhaps it was that or the guilt of not having read much over the course of the month that got me through the book Or perhaps it were these little paragraphs strewn thoroughout the book There are a few faint lines at the corners of her eyes and mouth that are the merest suggestion of the beginnings of Clare s face in middle age I will never see that face of hers and I regret it bitterly the face with which Clare will go on without me which will never be kissed by me which will belong to a world that I won t know except as a memory of Clare s relegated finally to a definite past About the latter is it because Audrey belongs to the gender that she writes so poignantly yet beautifully on the ravages of time With my head swarming with labels and sparkling people who are supposed to set the bar on beauty in these times not to mention one very irritating duo that my Facebook newsfeed informs me every day has broken the internet with their awesomeness this capacity to axle on the metamorphosis of beauty is refreshing The above for me was the high point of the book and it s all downhill from there The story itself is very one dimensional focused on taking the characters from one point to another without much to speak for the development of the story Being primarily a love story the book plays on the concept on inevitability such that girl falls in love with a boy who happens to appear out of nowhere to her on a meadow I can understand the curiosity but not the premise that it served as the linchpin of their supposedly epic love story Am I to believe that she fell in love with boy because he appeared to her Sounds kind of desperate and Audrey doesn t really provide me much of a counter argument Even when girl and boy meets in real time all girl wants is for boy to quickly become the man she knows from her childhood Another flaw that stuck in my mind is the accident that kills boy s mother that affects him so deeply that he travels in time countless times and ends up observing the accident from all angles revolving around the epicentre of the site of accident But that is it There s no road leading to or from this point and it just acts as one tidbit of information on boy s background that is thrown our way There are galores of such subplots in the story that lead nowhere and in a book that is pages long is really really well weak writing Audrey herself admitted in an interview of the many loop holes in her concept of time travel There is no butterfly effect since boy does not really travel to a different time stream and all the bugs he steps on are pre-ordained So when the old boy meets his younger self there isn t any consequence since his timeline itself is askew Thus old boy teaching young boy tricks of survival leads to a very chicken and egg situation that makes my head hurt when I try to understand the intricacies of it According to quantum mechanics time travel beyond a boundary layer of time with the invention of the machine itself as the centre starts breaking the fabric of time So as far as boy is concerned he adheres to this rule but his daughter is capable of bending in some cases utterly shattering this rule I get that an author has the freedom to construct her own rules in her fiction but considering that there is no explanation for why the daughter is different from father and the science in the story very very vague and leaves much to the reader to construct upon his her imagination After completing the story it seems to me that the only idea in the story was to give a character the capacity for time travel and the rest of the story is poorly constructed based on that premise A pity considering the potential The engineer in me scoffs the reader in me shakes my head No more"
"50","The time traveler's wife"," Cecily","really liked it"," A longish but quite easy read a charming and unusual mix of time travel paradoxes free will versus determinism co-incidences that aren t etc coupled with a non-soppy love story It handles some of the potentially dodgy situations very sensitively eg when adult Henry visits young Clare I m not sure I d write the ending the same way and got to the point where I almost didn t want to read on in case I didn t like it ACCIDENTAL TIME TRAVELNow that I ve read Kurt Vonnegut s Slaughterhouse Five review here and Octavia Butler s Kindred review here I realise the central idea of an occasional accidental time traveller is not hers Although that detracts from what I thought was her originality her book is very different and still an excellent read FILMI avoided the film as it looked horribly sentimental in a way the book largely avoids SHARED LIKINGThis is one the very few books my husband and I have both read and both enjoyed with the exception of some proper sci-fi more"
"51","The time traveler's wife"," Nandakishore Varma","it was amazing"," Do I call it SF Do I call it romance Do I call it fantasy There are elements of all the three in it but it s refreshingly different It s a unique new take on the time travel story where the traveller himself has no control over how he jumps across the time continuum - and the travel itself is not linear Time becomes meaningless so does death"
"52","The time traveler's wife"," Trish","did not like it"," Unfortunately you can t leave stars when rating a book on goodreads If it was possible this book would get stars from me and that would be generous I had high hopes years ago when purchasing the book since so many people were absolutely thrilled by it Until this very day I don t get why The author seems to be unable to make up her mind if she is writing a time-traveller-story fantasy combined with a love story or rather a book for cuisine-lovers and cultural attach es Many times there are lengthy descriptions of food and other stuff that crawl with high and mighty words only to be followed by the most dull dialogues So on one hand it seems like Niffenegger wants to be an over-achiever creating an artful book and not just tell a story while on the other she is incapable of even only getting you to like her characters And it s sad really because the story had so much potential For years I have tried to read this book two or three in fact and every time I stopped because I just couldn t take it anymore People critize Twilight s Bella and for good reason don t get me wrong for her utter self-abandonment in favour of a perfect being - but what is this book s protagonist doing Exactly THE VERY SAME THING She s sitting around waiting for Henry arranging her daily routine so that she can comfortably wait for him Yeah right Also I really couldn t feel for any of the characters Maybe it was the lack of distinction between them Sometimes I actually had to turn back to the start of a chapter to see from whose point of view it supposedly was because their voices were all the same So all in all it was an interesting idea but very poorly executed with dull and often unnecessary dialogues followed by antagonizing dissections of the very same dialogues in the following monologue of one main character or the other an absolute lack of character development no distinction between the characters - oh and let s not forget the almost racist descriptions of the servants at Clare s home An absolute waste of my time and I m so happy for it to be over Actually I wish I would simply have stopped reading the book years ago instead of wanting to know the ending and dragging myself from page to page Which only goes to show that you cannot trust in hypes and praise all too much I seriously don t know what any person could possibly see in this book more"
"53","The time traveler's wife"," Lizzy","liked it"," The Time Traveler s Wife is a love story and a rehearsal of science-fiction as it plays with the time-travel theme The plot skips back and forth between the point-of-view of Henry the time-traveler himself and Clare his wife However I felt there was little difference in their voices Nevertheless as Henry goes skipping through time against his will we hear both points of view One of the main issues that troubled me in Audrey Niffenegger s story is that neither protagonist has much choice in their destinies He suffers from a condition that makes him disappear from one time and appear on another randomly If Henry seems to have no control of his life Clare s life has been entirely determined by Henry Since he met her when she was only years old Henry seems to have in a sense seduced her for from them on her life becomes tethered to his Nevertheless leaving aside the ambiguity of their relationship there are interesting scenery changes with the time-travel shifts and an enduring and elusive love story with its own aches and longings A well told and enjoyable book more"

"55","The time traveler's wife"," StoryTellerShannon","it was ok"," THE TIME TRAVELER S WIFE is an interesting concept focusing on one of those what if questions that makes the contemporary setting suddenly fantastic While this is really a sci fi story it was marketed as fiction to attract more readers Hollywood is in the works to turn this into a film with rumors of Brad Pitt starring So the overall concept here is that a man and woman are married but the husband has a disease that makes him time warp either into the future or into the past of his life When he appears he is naked as nothing can be taken with him and so this begins to work to his disadvantage later in the tale He sometimes recognizes his wife and other times he does not when she recognizes him and this is all ages The main overall problem for me is that I found it tedious and slow to get through If that wasn t the case I would give this a higher score as there are some very interesting sub components to the theme even though there are some holes or logic gaps Thoughts below The story is told more in vignettes than a feeling that it is all structured together This can make it hard to follow if you are looking for an overall story thread The husband keeps time warping yet he somehow holds his job at the library Heh At one point the husband states the rule that even though he is time warping he cannot change the past or the future This rule seems to have been broken later when he wins the lottery so that they can move into a bigger house Woops The illness can pass to your children I found it peculiar that they decided to have a child who ended up getting this illness I am not saying parents would not do something like this as it happens all the time I would have preferred the reason for having a child be more explained by the parents The husband ends up visiting the wife when she is a child and this is supposedly their first meeting It didn t bother me but some people are going to be screaming pedophilia over it The husband comes across as a putz and weak around women I am unclear why the wife fell in love with him and I found her paper designs a bit too much for my tastes in the details and The guy meeting his older self and doing you know what was a bit much Yuck more"
"56","The time traveler's wife"," Gabby","liked it"," I ve wanted to read this book for years and I finally got around to it This book has a shit ton of hype and is considering the greatest romance of all time when in reality this story is just okay I think the concept is interesting for sure it follows Henry a time traveler who meets his wife Clare when she is a young girl It follows them over decades as he tries to figure out why this happens to him and it sucks because he has no control over it so he can just disappear out of Clare s life at any moment in time Clare and Henry are okay characters but I never really connected with either of them Clare has no life outside of Henry and all she ever thinks about and talks about is Henry so it got kind of irritating at times Henry on the other hand has a pretty interesting back story and I found his character slightly more interesting than Clare but not by much Can we also talk about how creepy this concept is I mean a full grown man appears completely nude in the meadow behind Clare s house when she is only a little girl and it s love at first sight I guess He asks her to bring him some of her Dad s clothes and he doesn t flirt with her or do anything weird but it s still weird Imagine if Clare s parents found out about him when she was a little girl They would freak the fuck out I m sure of it Overall this concept is interesting and this story is okay but it s nothing sensational and certainly not something I m going to remember in a few months Also this book was way too long for what it was It was over pages and it could ve easily been cut down by pages or more There were so many filler pointless scenes especially the scenes of their dreams I was expecting more from one of the apparent greatest love stories of all time but I guess that s setting the bar kind of high more"

"60","The time traveler's wife"," Liza","really liked it"," I want the option of stars I give this one I m always afraid of two things when I ve been as captivated by a book as I have been this one The first is that no one else will feel the same way I do about it What if it s actually horrible and for some reason I love it I m no literary genius after all But I suppose we are all entitled to our own opinions and there are certainly plenty of great reads out there that I am sure I did not love or would not love if I ever read them The second happens about of the way in and can be a little suffocating if you think you know what s going to happen the fear of finishing What if it s as sad as I am expecting What if all my questions aren t answered What if I just don t want the story to end What if I m not as satisfied as I think I should be once it has actually ended and there s no hope of more Nevertheless I always finish And I am resolved to the fact that just because I love something doesn t mean you will love it too and that s ok This book brought out these fears in an immensely incredible way for me Sometimes I connect with a book because I feel like I am actually watching the story play out but only as an outsider sort of as if I am good friends with the characters But sometimes rarely I connect with a book because I feel like I am the character That was the case with this book And that s why I couldn t stop reading David is finally finished so I can say more I loved the first half of this book Since we meet Clare when she is so young I felt like I sort of grew up with her getting to know this time-traveling Henry at the same time as her But even in the first half I struggled with a few things Where did The List come from And how did two Henry s appear at the same time and place so often Maybe we aren t supposed to know those things but they bothered me a bit But I was easily caught up in the lives of the characters and sort of swept away by their story Captivated really The nd half was a little more frustrating and not quite as lovable though still very enjoyable and able to keep my attention for looong periods of time But my fear of finishing with my questions still unanswered was a legitimate fear here and I think maybe that plays into my not liking the nd half as much I contrary to David did not like the ending Maybe I just wanted more I m not sure I just know I felt a little let down at the end Clare and Henry went through a whole lot of crap all for it to end way too early in their lives And Alba never really gets to know Henry I know that not all stories are supposed to end happy and I am not a fan of writing a happy ending just for the sake of a happy ending But I think Clare and Henry got a little cheated here Her knowledge of Henry coming at some point is not enough for me She spends the rest of her life just waiting on him to show up never knowing when he will After having The List as a child and then having him almost constantly as an adult until his death it just seems unfair that after his death she gets up every day and waits to see if it s a day he will arrive I finished feeling rather sorry for Clare and Alba and frustrated for Henry but having enjoyed their story immensely up until that point more"

"63","The time traveler's wife"," Adam Dalva","really liked it"," Romantic as hell and a compulsive pleasure - the concept given away in the title is often brilliant and very well thought out There are so many moments here that will stick with me and the book has a pleasurable structure that will make it re-readable it was great to go back and read the first pages knowing what I knew about Henry and Clare - one of the great couples in books Problems You betcha A N s prose is good but her dialogue is stilted strange unique maybe to have dialogue in a much HIGHER register than descriptive prose There are three too many supportive friend characters who are minorities with stereotypical attributes whose plot function is solely to help the white protagonists a literal actual Mammy a sassy Korean lady a gay man with HIV I think the ending though decent could have been better the hazards of writing your end first But man not only could I not put this down I was genuinely moved by it There s something timeless haha about it that I think very well might endure Perhaps it s more great than good Perhaps the melding of sci-fi experimentalism and contemporary realist prose works well But maybe it s just that love is wonderful more"

"70","The time traveler's wife"," Jennifer aka EM","liked it"," It s been a long time since I ve stayed up late into the night reading just another chapter and then another and so what if it s a m and tears are streaming down my cheeks and all that s left to read are the acknowledgements at the end and I do because I m as unwilling to let these characters go as they are to let each other go The themes of this novel are as complex as you want to make them freewill versus determinism genetic abnormalities relativity and evolutionary theory memories love death loss and our relationship to time But aside from the themes that lend the story depth this novel is first and foremost a powerful love story The science fiction premise of time travelling is dramatic and effective to keep the story moving along albeit in a disconcertingly non-linear--and occasionally confusing--fashion and to illuminate the themes I found myself interested in how the conceit was working and trying to sort out the internal logic of both the time travel and of Henry s chromosomal disability But that quickly took second fiddle to the main story arc Glossing over the inconsistencies in the logic of Henry s time travel is important to preserve the believability of the rest of the story Niffenegger has a less-than-adequate mastery of the time travel conceit She would do well to study Roddenberry s Star Trek The Next Generation time-space continuum rift narratives if she chooses to continue in a sci-fi vein for her second novel Regardless time travelling serves primarily here as a device to illustrate how people and in particular Clare and Henry find each other and how their individual stories and the events of their lives become interwoven into an us that is both inevitable and random If we reject the science fiction premise as poorly executed or too science fiction-ey to be believable--especially as nested within this story that is otherwise so very normal --we can still look on the bouncing around through time and space as being an apt analogy for memory and we can all relate to that We reminisce about the happy times reliving them again and again to sustain us in times of difficulty We ruminate about past hurts and traumas unable to let them go Both the good and the bad memories shape us into the people we are Henry is frustrated by knowing what is going to happen but is unable because he didn t the first time around to change the outcome Often we wish we could go back in time and change things recognizing all the while that--whether for good or for ill--every experience we ve had has made us into who we are Niffenegger is clever in showing us how our place in time--the music we listen to the books we read the clothes we wear--do more than just define us at any given age they carry forward into the people we become Niffenberger plays with the theme of time travel in myriad ways some subtle and some ironic but all with the intention of looking at time place space and memory from every possible angle As Clare looks down at the dance floor at the Violent Femmes concert she notes the audience is in their teens s s and even some older Henry and his younger self travel backwards in time from the th to the th to the th Centuries as they stroll through successive rooms in the museum On a trip from Chicago to Michigan Clare and Henry remark on how strange it is to skip ahead an hour moving from Central to Eastern timezone These images reinforce the much larger question of how we are shaped by the times in which we live Henry s affinity for punk music gives him a certain identity in his s but is no less important at defining him in his late- s The opportunity Henry has to re-experience events at different ages and stages as a child then as a young adult then in middle-age give him an enviable omniscience The implication is that Henry gains a perspective and wisdom that we lesser-evolved lifeforms never have he occupies some realm between human and angel Clare s fascination for angels and birds and her lapsed Catholicism--none of which are overtly explored in any heavy-handed way--resonate when played off of the spiritual connotations of Henry s uniqueness But the bottom line the consistent theme and the anchor point for the story is the love between these two characters Henry is a planet revolving around Clare his sun She gives his life shape direction and purpose And the sun is nothing without having something to shine upon Clare needs Henry as much as he needs her Thankfully the story doesn t degenerate into some saccharine clich -- although I now hear it is being made into a movie starring Rachel McAdams and if anyone can make a rich complex and powerful love story into a trite chick-flick it would be her more"

"73","The time traveler's wife"," Matt","really liked it"," Yeats once wrote Man is in love and loves what vanishes What more is there to say I kept thinking of this line while reading The Time Traveler s Wife not only because one of the protagonists librarian cum time traveler Henry De Tamble keeps disappearing but because the through-line of this story is the finiteness of our existence coupled with our fervent attempts e g love to capture the infinite In Wife Henry the time traveler is in love with Clare The problem is he keeps getting unstuck in time traveling backwards and forwards to various parts of his and Clare s life Trying to keep the narrative clear is quite difficult even with the helpful headings for each chapter which tell you the the day and date as well as the character who is telling the story the book uses alternating first-person narrators Clare and Henry I suppose I could ve have kept better track but I didn t find it necessary to my enjoyment Indeed while the central conceit is a touchstone of science fiction the time traveling aspect is taken as something of a given There s an explanation of sorts - chrono-displacement disorder - but the point of the book isn t the time traveling it s the consequences of not being able to be with the person you love On the back cover one of the reviewers states this is an unconventional love story I disagree wholeheartedly This is a most conventional love story complicated by time travel By conventional I mean it hews to the traditional arc of love in literature boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl back Adding time travel serves as a profound way of exploring what it means to love This isn t LOST or Back to the Future or God help us The Butterfly Effect in which the paradoxes and dangers of time travel are explored Rather Audrey Niffenegger uses it to highlight the highs and lows of any great love the hope the faith the waiting as Bryan Adams once sang Your lonely nights have just begun when you love someone I recently saw Fincher s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button which explored a similar theme as Wife namely that when we choose to love we choose to give our hearts to something that will end All love is doomed That is what makes it special In the face of eternity we humans willingly sneer at our mortality Even knowing that all things come down to heartbreak and dust we press on In that way Wife s use of time travel is haunting all things are and all things have already been Throughout the course of the book Henry bounces to different time periods Everytime he leaves his present he appears naked in the past This of course has its problems He is beaten arrested must steal for food and clothing He is forced to relive the death of his mother who is decapitated on the Dan Ryan Expressway Henry often goes back to meet Clare when Clare is a child which is a little creepy of course but Henry is very adamant that he not go all Roman Polanski on us and waits till Clare is Clare comes to believe that time traveling Henry is telling the truth she falls in love with him and must wait for years to finally meet him when she is and he is This is where things can get confusing if you are paying too much attention It s never clear who the main character is is it time traveling Henry or the Henry that time traveling Henry visits This is important because you need to know who to invest with At times it gets very unclear what the rules of space-time-travel are I don t really care for all the paradoxes and gladly point anyone who is to the Futurama episode where Fry becomes his own grandfather Still if you re going to get into this business you should make some groundrules ala Back to the Future s model of whatever you change in the past will change the future Henry often says that you can t change the future which leads to a sad passage on September when one version of Henry wakes up early to enjoy the world s last peaceful day Then at other times Henry uses his foreknowledge to give his friend s stock tips and lotto numbers Isn t that changing the future Or is that the future and everything he s doing now is as its supposed to be In which case time is sort of an endless loop right My head just exploded That s why it s best not to think about it Ignore the quantum physics of the time travel and enjoy what it reveals about us humans and our foolish hearts Also enjoy it for its amazing verisimilitude for its description of Chicago at different times over the decades is quite amazing I visited recently for the first time and could have used the book as a road map The final thing I have to say is that Niffenegger is something of a musical literary cultural snob And I say this admiringly She owes a debt to A S Byatt s Possession as well as to Andrew Marvell s To His Coy Mistrees the phrase world enough and time is repeated throughout the story It s helpful to know these underpinning works There are also numerous allusions to operas singers and famous works I ve never heard of I don t usually feel provincial when it comes to these matters but I certainly did here I just had to face the fact that her characters were much better read than I was they also eat much fancier food I cried throughout the last or so pages and I don t usually cry while reading After spending so much time with these two characters it s a five-hundred page book fighting through space and time to be with each other I felt their terrifying desperation as they were stalked by inevitability There was only one way for this book to end There is only one way for anything that lives to end We all are born and we all die and the meaning comes in the fleeting love we share during the interregnum more"
"74","The time traveler's wife"," Francine","really liked it"," I am not a linear book-reader That is I rarely ever read a book contiguously from start to finish I have a very bad habit of reading the last dozen or so pages first just to see if I will like the story It s a bit irrational I don t know what I m looking for but somehow reading those last words gives me an impression of what to expect of whether I should buy a book or pass on it or even if I will like a book or not Personally I don t think that reading the end first takes anything away from the story since I don t know what led up to it and I often feel strangely rewarded at the end by those aha moments when what I know of the ending becomes evident Still I know it drives some people i e Jim crazy and for that apologies Once I start reading I also have a tendency to go back to certain sections repeatedly including the ending thus prolonging the experience while also gaining more insight into the characters situations the language used etc So in many ways my style of reading probably suited the way how this novel was written the beginning presupposed the end and the time traveling aspects of the story - jumping back and forth through time - did not detract from my going back and forth through the novel either It complemented it very well in fact that I am now a proud owner of a very dog-eared copy with the binding a bit ragged and very nearly unglued - That said I must say I really enjoyed The Time Traveler s Wife I stop short of claiming that I loved it only because there were parts of the novel - specifically towards the end - that bothered and frustrated me My discomfiture however did not take anything away from relishing the narrative itself I loved the characters I loved the writing style I loved the intelligence of both the author and the narrative The prose - her writing the attention to detail the exquisite imagery - was sublime and oftentimes visceral Sometimes what she wrote was almost too painful to read in a good way Similarly the poetry was heartwrenching it made me want to re-read Rilke Homer and Dickinson as well as Byatt s Possession with a different lens I did feel as if there were a few questions left unanswered in the end such as what happened to Alba Yes the title of the book is not The Time Traveler s Daughter I suppose what happened to Alba in the grand scheme of things is irrelevant since we find out what happens to Clare The parts that troubled me the most occurred in the third part at the end Her one-word chapter titles Dissolution Dasein and Renascence said more than enough I found these last chapters the hardest to get through I was telling Jim I could ve finished the book weeks ago but I had to keep putting it down because there were parts I found extremely upsetting even though they were probably the most critical chapters in the novel because for the first time it finally dealt with Clare after Henry For as much as the novel was about Henry s wife it was also his story and a majority of the book dealt with their lives They were inextricably linked through time and space for most of the book but here at the end it was all about Clare Clare alone Clare lost Clare trapped Clare waiting Throughout the novel Clare typified her art as being simply about birds and about longing But as her story unfolded her art became a metaphor for freedom it became about finding her wings and Henry s and gaining freedom from the body from time from its intricacies and paradoxes from the problems it caused from the world What was so unnerving however was the meaning behind those three chapter titles and what happened in each chapter Dissolution disintegrating breaking bonds falling apart Dasein a being that is constituted by its temporality something that illuminates and interprets the meaning of Being in Time and a way of choosing to either remain engaged in the world or distanced from it all the while questioning what it means to be now there s a throwback to my literary criticism days when we were studying Heidegger - I never liked Heidegger because everything was a circular argument everything seemed paradoxical because everything seemed causal And then Renascence a rebirth a renaissance There s a passage in the book towards the end of the second part when Henry says The pain has receded but what s left is the shell of the pain an empty space where there should be pain but instead there is the expectation of pain During Dissolution and Dasein Clare lived these words Clare never achieved the freedom she longed for her life and her freedom were directly linked to Henry s and when he was gone a part of her died with him too She becomes nothing more than a shell someone who gives up her art someone who just drives her daughter around someone who is a part of the world but is not engaged in it Someone who just is In Renascence Clare finally creates something new After decades of creating birds wings angels and drawings of Henry and Alba she finally creates one of herself And this new art form surprises her because it takes on a much bigger scope than anything she had created in the past this time it s a constellation a galaxy a universe of stars and she s lost in the vastness of something so huge so intangible At the end she states I regard my likeness and she returns my gaze I place my finger on her forehead and say Vanish but it is she who will stay I am the one who is vanishing There is beauty in such tragedy and that s what made it so hard to read so hard to end more"

"76","The time traveler's wife"," Quinn","liked it"," The last thing this book needs is another review so I will just share some brief thoughts I m struggling a little to determine a rating for this book and I find myself thinking of concept vs execution I liked the concept of the plot and structure of this book but I found the execution lacking The Time Traveler s Wife is told from the alternate viewpoints of Henry and his wife Clare Unfortunately there is absolutely no distinction between their voices By necessity each passage identified who was narrating otherwise it would have been very difficult to determine I am also intrigued as to the title of the novel I had expected this novel would explore the character of Clare and provide insight into the effects of loving someone who disappears in time without notice or reason As it was the title character was singularly underdeveloped We never got to really know Clare She was defined by her love for Henry and to a lesser extent her art That was it We received no exploration of her emotions or state of mind no insight or understanding of her character at all and certainly no growth In fact on reflection most of the secondary characters were stereotypical cardboard cut-outs Henry was the only character we really got to know in any detail and even then great chunks were missing and inconsistencies were not explored Most significantly we never got to see Henry fall in love with Clare after he first meets her It just was Which probably leads me to another concern I had with the execution Everything was told not shown so it was difficult to feel any real connection to the characters So while I really did like the story being told I also felt that this book was a missed opportunity What could have been a powerfully moving novel became interesting in an almost detached way The ending was sad but my emotions were engaged as a result of my own imagination rather than solely through the experience provided by the book stars but it could have been so much better I haven t yet seen the film but this is one of the few occasions where I imagine the movie might just beat the book more"

it view spoiler but I wish it had a different ending although it would ve taken some of the intensity and impact away With the way it went though nothing else could ve happened hide spoiler So I loved LOVED it So original and got me to feel so much Going away to cry now The Morning After Assuming the premise of the book is known From a purely emotional viewpoint Don t you think it s better to be extremely happy for a short while even if you lose it than to be just okay for your whole life I m shattered and ecstatic at the same time Have you ever felt that after reading a book Like after you stop crying you will still feel the sweetness of the good left Well it has happened now for me The truth is I ve been avoiding this book for quite some time now because I didn t want to put myself through the pain knew would be there but then I just figured I did want to try it And I m so so glad This was an AMAZINGLY beautiful love story IMHO Unusually written through the different times while Henry time travels in and out of Clare s life It s strange that when you think about it I thought it would be weird for a -year-old Henry who has already married Clare to be meeting her -year-old self And it is unusual but it is all so so great And we can see the love that connects them If you re afraid of getting lost or confused It is possible but we mostly follow the story chronologically Clare-onologically I mean Henry follows a different schedule So we see her grow up knowing Henry is in her life to stay At first for her he is an angel then a guardian a friend and eventually more And it is not easy loving him Because he always leaves where she cannot follow and there s a lot of danger in appearing in another time buck naked in front of who knows who forced to defend yourself and so she knows and worries and misses him And then they finally meet in both their Presents and they are together And they continue to love and hurt and they re together through everything It s all one big puzzle And it s great fitting together the pieces of time and the travel and Henry and Clare s life I loved them both so so much And everything they suffered hurt God so much But the ending God I know it couldn t have been different and the foreshadowing was heavy but I wanted a miracle there I said it And not getting it hurt all the more Just to think all the waiting left to be done And the last of Clare s POV Geez If I wasn t crying by then I would ve there I did expect to see more of the years in between To see what happened with her view spoiler Did she remarry have kids WHAT What did she do but wait for him and love him Was she truly fading remembering living that way What about Alba hide spoiler All in all as I said a great complex addictive original love story and a great love too But see that quote up there Too prophetic And I did know But I totally get why a lot of people love it I do too Even as i wish for a different ending From a purely logical viewpoint After the emotional turmoil passed mostly I started remembering this also occupied my mind during the read As in Dude time travel Paradoxes two Henrys talking to each other and so on And the question what came first You see Henry time traveled to little Clare when he was in his thirties after the wedding So she met him and came to love him before they met in real time And when they did because she had already loved him they came to be together and she gave him the dates of the travels and told him what happens So did they have a choice Their love is like a loop that has no beginning because it is always in someone s past Speaking of the issue of changing the past the future whatever With time I came to like the way it was explained here Whenever you time travel what happens is in someone s past Say TT Henry meets little Henry and they talk It is in Henry s past and he remembers it so TT Henry acts accordingly Or it is in someone s past so TT Henry can t change it And if he goes to the future than the event will be in his past Capisce If not blame me I try to explain and may do it muddily but it is clear when Henry explains it to his kid self As to how he travels Well I liked how everything was discussed and interwoven here theology physics biology philosophy and in the end explained in a way I found sufficient Are there things that bug me and perceived logic-holes Yes But that compared to the amazingly written emotional aspect isn t that relevant to me All I wanted was for things to make sense to me And so they did and I could completely focus on Clare and Henry There are some quotes below because I was too absorbed to pick some out myself while reading One other thing The name of the book is fitting IMO Although the POV of Henry and Clare are constantly changing the book follows her road with brief time irregularities and I sympathize with her for forever waiting for him and it takes a great woman to love a man that s not close to normal I loved him too but it is always more difficult for the ones left behind more"
"78","The time traveler's wife"," Chana","it was amazing"," Absolutely extraordinary unique and very very beautiful I was absorbing this book into my soul with every lovingly crafted word There was one scene in this book which affected me particularly deeply I didn t lose a husband I lost a child but there is one scene in which I was reminded of a poignant moment in my own life I was on a plane with my family a year after the death of my son My four year old daughter was on the seat next to me sleeping I had my left arm around her and was absently stroking her cheek Without awareness I must have been physically reminded by my daughter of my deceased son at that age and it was as if I was holding him again For just a few moments I experienced the fullness of being that I used to have the emptiness was gone for a few moments and I was able to cry in a very deep and healing way I think that this book probably has an affect on anyone who has ever loved someone else very deeply And it makes one crave that deep love also You can t just love someone because you want to or ought to it is a gift My opinion of the book is that it is phenomenal more"

"80","The time traveler's wife"," Samadrita","liked it"," One of those books which I d like to label over-rated The backdrop is interesting - time-travel and the works But that s just a backdrop and this is not a piece of science fiction The characters are cliched the constant Clare-Henry interactions are annoying and you couldn t care less about them or their problems when their love is so obviously half-baked And you pretty much lose interest when they don t seem to have a life or purpose outside their relationship But this is all in the first half The latter part of the story does pack in some punch with the author kicking it up a notch or two in the emotional roller-coaster department By the end you re touched as it has a good and poignant ending All in all not bad but not that stellar either more"

"83","The time traveler's wife"," Joyzi","it was amazing"," Awesome book in my opinion especially that I have a thing for time traveling I love it the story is interesting even though it s confusing at first because the story is not chronological and the author would just arrange each story by any timeline past future present I also love the characters Henry librarian time traveler and Clare artist and of course their daughter Alba also time traveler It s just sad though and I m not expecting it that in the end the story became depressing I also love the part wherein Henry saw Clare writing the date in one of her work and Henry says that I saw in the future that it has no date in it so you should not write the date And Clare wanted to somehow break the rules of what should happen and still write the date on it and say that What is the big deal if I write the date or not Henry kind of scares her that maybe something terrible happen like a war or something if they kind of change something even if it s a small thing So when Henry goes in the future again he looks for the drawing and was surprise that it does not have a date on it and he asks Clare since he knows that in the past they decided to put a date on it then what the heck happen and Clare says that she was kind of scared about the war thing so when he left she decided to chipped off the date It just felt clever to me that somehow the past present and future are interrelated in ways that you can t even change it even the future It s just whatever happens you can t change it anymore And also the part wherein he time travels and he went to Ingrid s apartment and when he asks Ingrid the date and he knows that this is the day wherein Ingrid killed herself and he thought that maybe he can change that but the inevitable happens and Ingrid killed herself in front of him This is just a great book if you love time traveling and dejavu more"

"87","The time traveler's wife"," Naddy","liked it"," I wanted to read something under Science fiction genre but at the same time I wanted something not too heavy like whole book is flooded with quantum physics biology or something And I liked the concept of Time Travel part like vicious cycle of forward backward and so on So I picked up The Time Traveler s book Henry first meeting in the book he was and then or or or He is so accustomed to be living on metaphysical trapeze where we as human tend to enjoy solid ground Clare knows since the age of six and Henry was whom she gonna date married there was a cuteness when she believed Henry really a time traveler Both the characters are wonderful real people with strengths and flaws generally lovers often believe themselves crossed by fate or by time but in this novel they have more reasons than most The things which I like about this book - The second part of the part was quite hooked at times funny while Clare and henry were getting married and they were trying to hold him for the moment How the time travel part could have been avoided during that time - Totally blown and swayed by the ending I am sure there will be many who have cried while reading Henry later - I liked the part when Henry tries to explain Clare even if I am not here don t think I am some dimension or void which has been created and can t be fulfilled Although that was not something new but the way it was executed I found it different and fresh - At times I so want to time travel at least I will get to know whom I will get married in future P- Casual and continuous time loops quantum mechanics photos speed of light how it feels to be living outside of the time constraints when human are subject to live in time The things which I didn t like about this book - Too much emphasis on the adolescence tail of Clare all about what her domestic help cooks n all favorite dishes- Abortion episodes it would have been better if there were more details about the DNA genes replacement part basically science The teenage part were filled with pages whereas the science part was tried to cover in- On the science part I feels this books lacks research - At times too dramatic - pages were way too much for this type of story I am sure hard editing would have easily chucked out - pages The things which enlightens me - About book - The chronicles of Nawat Wuzeer Hyderabad a book made by human skin Though didn t find any results on google - About the Chinese Poet Wu chen The certainty about the future gives both of them a quasi-religious sense that their lives are already mapped out and the time of their deaths already written In a couple of particularly sentimental scenes Henry manages to visit Clare and his daughter after his own death and in those moments there is the evanescent comfort of a vague spirituality An elegy to love and lossIf you want to read a romantic novel with a twitch of Science fiction then read - The Time Traveler s Wife then give it a try I will sign off with mixed feeling not too happy or not too sad What an uncertain husband I have been like a Sailor Odysseus alone and buffeted by tall waves sometimes wily and sometimes just a plaything of Gods Please Claire when I am dead Stop waiting and be free Love the world and yourself in it moves through it as it offers no resistance as though world is your natural element I have given u life of suspended animation You have created beauty and meaning through your art more"
"88","The time traveler's wife"," Vanessa","it was ok"," stars rarely books make me angry this one did I honestly enjoyed the first part of the novel with my whole heart to the point that I even thought I was falling in love with it I found myself interested in how time travel worked for Henry he basically can travel to the past and the future but only to places bound to people he loves instead of jumping through time and space without a specific criterion I adored Clare as a character and their relationship even if a bit problematic at times was definitely entertaining to read The second part instead was disastrous It tried so hard to be overdramatic and a tear-jerker which I think worked for lots of people that made me sick I literally felt nauseous while reading certain things The character of Clare was completely ruined she becomes suddenly whiny about Henry time traveling even if she always knew this would have happened we had to read about view spoiler her six abortions in details which were very gory and weren t really pleasing or even easy to absorb only for her to finally have a daughter the seventh time - and we don t really know why she didn t abort this time - and not caring about her child At a certain point she says that she prefers to spend her time alone without Henry and Alba therefore to me it seems like this whole plot had only a function manipulate readers feelings hide spoiler and we discover that she even view spoiler cheats twice with her best friend s husband Gomez the first time when she was and she was supposedly in love with Henry and the other when she is after Henry died she never feels guilty about having had sex with him and keeps lying to her best friend hide spoiler For these two reasons I started to strongly dislike her I hated how the author tried to explain time travel scientifically for no reason at all since the whole work this Dr Kendrick did didn t work inside the plot so what was the point The ending was the most terrible thing I ve ever read in a book view spoiler Henry dies after having had his feet amputated after an hypothermia and time traveling but not being able to walk is shot by Clare s brother who was hunting which doesn t make sense Beyond that them meeting when Clare is is an overused clich letting old people see their lovers for a last time clearly used to make the readers cry so hard hide spoiler Sadly it didn t work for me Not only that but I felt irritated and mocked for the entire time more"
"89","The time traveler's wife"," Luffy","really liked it"," The Time Traveler s Wife is the only book where I ve considered giving it and five stars at some point It started off with a strong quality in the writing which was at first a story about two people coming together After that I feared about misunderstanding what the story was about But the beginning was simply a purely intimate exchange between two people I thought that by being fated to be stuck together Clare and Henry lost some free will Like their high point was consuming an arranged marriage like it occurs mostly in the third world But maybe they never compromised at all Maybe compromise is a portmanteau of comme promis There is some arbitrary French and even more German peppered through the story Also bands and music artists names References to art I can imagine that the writer is making a comparison between free will and destiny and life and art You see I never bother about guessing the writer s intent in most books And in my current avatar as an Amazon customer I ve read primarily mysteries But here the subject is so private that I m anxious But that in itself is impossible and silly It s also nice to ruminate about the titular character Clare is the time traveler s wife The title could not have been the time traveler s child for example I think the last chapter decides the earnestness of the whole book and is the latter s spine I wish I had read this beautiful story earlier My God how could they make a mess of adapting the book for the big screen The movie is absolutely dreadful The author remained inspired throughout and the book never loses steam I have read about Henry and known him in a way not possible in other mediums I would however not like to meet him Like Gomez said he s not right It s safe to conclude that the meeting with Clare tempers Henry s devilish side This is not a science fiction story It s not perfect If the book WAS perfect I d say read it and weep But I did not so it s not more"
"90","The time traveler's wife"," Apatt","it was amazing"," If I was a struggling or mid range sf author I d probably be very annoyed with Audrey Niffenegger how dare she write a romantic first novel using a popular sf trope and sell them on mainstream shelves by the truck load Fortunately I am not an author of any kind so I feel more forgiving I think she dared because she has a very good story to tell and knows she is capable of telling it effectively My only annoyance with this book is that it is not marketed as sf when it clearly is sf even though the emphasis is not on the sf side of it I am also annoyed that since the commercial success of this novel Ms Niffenegger has not decided to pursue a career as an sf author This novel shows that she belongs to this genre She even coins a very sf-ish term chrono-impaired for the protagonist Henry DeTamble s involuntary time travelling condition how sci-fi is that Of course since this book is not hard sf no rhyme or reason is given for Henry s uncontrollable time traveling He just does it OK It is no more unbelievable than FTL travel through hyperspace or teleportation That said the time traveling element is very well done I personally can not find any illogical paradoxes that can bring the whole story down like a house of cards I don t suppose the internal logic of the story is entirely water-tight more observant or analytical sf readers than myself will probably find some logical fallacies to grumble about but it is smooth enough for me Given that time travel is not the point of this novel the characterization need to be the priority for the author Both the lead characters are likable and believable their romantic relationship which is the heart of this book is suitably poignant and the pathos at the end is rightly emotional At no time did I cry like a little girl but the corners of my mouth did droop a little bit and I finished the book with a warm and tingly feeling So yes a solid recommendation for anyone who likes a good time travel story with a touch well a massive heap of romance more"

"98","The time traveler's wife"," Sofi","did not like it"," Hey ho let s go This is the first book I have ever given one star to Part of that is purely my own fault I asked if anyone had any recommendations for romance on a different website and this is the only recommendation that I received So I decided to go for it knowing fully well that science fiction is not a genre that I enjoy Nor do I like sad books This seemed sad the whole way through And here we are Not surprised at all that I did not enjoy this book and spent of it bored out of my mind This review is going to have spoilers For much of this book I kept on zoning out because the author would give ridiculously long descriptions of silly things like what Henry bought at the grocery store Sure list a couple of items that would be a nice glimpse into the characters and their every day life But for god s sake do not list fifty regular grocery items that mostly everybody buys Or go on and on and on about stuff that Henry does at the library or every step of the process Clare goes through for her art That is just too much You lost me long ago Please move on None of the description really gave insight into how the characters were feeling either Well I guess there were little things here and there but there just wasn t enough And there wasn t enough about their emotions when it really counted I did not like how POC characters were treated in this book at all They felt like caricatures who were only there to serve the two main characters You re telling me that these characters only exist for their lives to revolve around these two main characters and their families I think this was made worse by the audiobook so this could just be my personal opinion The narrators kept on doing obnoxious voices that seemed vaguely racist and it irked me I wanted better for the side characters they just weren t treated right I really didn t like how mental illness and suicide was treated as well There was one character Ingrid who dated Henry and was brushed off as attention seeking because she had overdosed and attempted suicide so many times And the main reason she ends up killing herself is because Henry married Clare instead She was treated as a villain near the end and it was really upsetting Also Henry was creepy af I think we were supposed to start liking him somewhere along the way but he started out creepy and he remained creepy and I never liked him By the end the reader is supposed to sympathize with him but I just couldn t I didn t like how he basically took advantage of Clare Honestly she deserved better She wasn t a super likable character but she was still a lot better than Henry When he was out of the picture I liked the story a lot better and I m pretty sure that s not supposed to be the case And she was still such a bland character Her whole life revolved around Henry and worrying about Henry and waiting for Henry Girl calm down he is nothing special She didn t even have a chance to enjoy her own life because she was told from the time that she was really young that she was going to marry this creepy man The fact that she loses her virginity to him when she is eighteen and he is in his forties is so gosh darn creepy Is anyone else creeped out by that It can t just be me Literally expresses exactly what kept going through my mind throughout the entire book whenever Henry showed up to bother Clare Clare and Ingrid deserved better Perhaps the worst thing is that this book was so long I feel like I wasted so much valuable October reading time forcing myself to get through it I had already bought the audiobook so I felt like I needed to finish it just so I hadn t wasted my money But I could have lived my whole life without reading this and been perfectly content Plus this book simply made me depressed It went past putting me into a reading funk and just made me purely depressed and made me question why I read books at all That is all In the words of Henry at the end of this book I am very tired myself I am off to find something better to read that will remind me why I love to read again Edit I forgot to mention the fact that this book sends a damaging message about adoption and the idea that an adopted baby is a fake baby more"
"99","The time traveler's wife"," Gabrielle","it was ok"," Somewhere between and stars but we ll go with for now I got curious about this book when the Doctor Who writers mentioned that it had been a big influence on the story arc of River Song - who was arguably one of my favorite things about the Matt Smith years of the show God I miss those two Moving on Henry suffers from a curious medical condition called chrono-impairment which makes him travel in time in a completely uncontrollable and unpredictable way To makes matters more complicated when he time travels he can t bring any physical objects with him which means he vanishes out of his clothes and pops naked wherever Time sees fit to drop him These episodes are of varying and irregular lengths which obviously makes him life rather challenging The only thing that s constant in his life is Clare his beloved wife The problem is that they are on different time-lines so to speak when he first meets her he is in his late twenties and she has just turned twenty But she remembers meeting him when she was six and he was much older There s not denying that the idea is very original Sure there s temporal displacement in Kindred which I loved https www goodreads com review show but the focus of the book is completely different The Time Traveler s Wife is first and foremost a story about impossible love - something a lot people find inexplicably romantic I on the other hand am a fan of possible love life is sufficiently complicated without adding a million hurdles between yourself and the object of your affection but I digress I approached this book cautiously ready to be mildly nauseated by the romance And then I got annoyed with other stuff While the set up of the story is very interesting and opens up the door to many thoughts and discussions about pre-determination free-will and love that endures beyond the bounds of time to quote the back cover I couldn t help but notice that Henry has no personality Everything about him hinges on his temporal displacement problem his character is not developed any further than that We know he runs that he is a good cook that he s a punk-enthusiastic librarian which I admit is a sexy combination and that the relationship with his dad is strained and that s all So Clare falling all over herself for him just feels sort of random Speaking of Clare I suppose families like hers who dress in formal attire for dinner and have servants are still a thing in a few places but it added to my feeling that writing this story was really a huge projection of the author s personal fantasies Not to mention that she is also terribly underdeveloped red-headed artists who have been emotionally damaged by their mothers are kind of a dime-a-dozen in romance novels And then of course there s the tiny problem that her entire life is determined by meeting and falling in love with Henry when she s six meaning she never really has any kind of agency which bothers me But it wasn t until she got obsessed with having a baby a naturally conceived one because adopting would be fake whatever the fuck that means that I started actively disliking her And they say its the ones who choose to be childless that are selfish So much name-dropping Of books musicians architects exotic dishes We get the hint Audrey Niffenegger is cultured and sophisticated It makes a perfect example of telling not showing but ineffective because if you don t know the references you have no idea what s going on This will either make you feel dumb or super smart I guess Add to that a rather average kind of prose with mostly unnatural sounding dialogue and you get and easy to read meh novel that starts out very promising but doesn t really push the envelope in any way I thought it was a good book until I really started to think about it River Song s story is more interesting more"
"100","The time traveler's wife"," Kate","did not like it"," Ok first off I didn t finish the book I did get to page and oddly enough I had to force myself to put the book down Why the one-star then Because this book what I read of it was awful As for forcing myself to put it down I kept hoping it would improve especially as the story began to veer away from Clare as a child which I found boring I found the the portion of the story where Henry meets Clare as a kid completely ridiculous really a yo is going to cooperate with a naked man in her backyard gross In any case once the story started incorporating punk rock bands I was intrigued I know many reviewers were off-put by Niffenegger s use of hipster bands I don t find them to be hipster at all but whatever but it didn t bother me Sadly the Violent Femmes and Smoking Popes could not save this book for me I think time travel is a totally cool thing to think about but it doesn t work in fiction for me at least not when it s a genetic disorder I prefer my time travel via a machine and physics Not some gene deletion or whatever afflicts Henry As a student of biology and science it s TOO unbelievable and just stupid It s totally illogical At least if physics were used maybe they were and I missed it I realize this is a love story and time travel was secondary but I found its implausibility too annoying to ignore The format of Henry blah blah blah and Clare wah wah wah was distracting Clare was BORING B-O-R-I-N-G At page I hadn t learned enough about Henry to fully form an opinion other than how the EFF could he keep a job if he kept disappearing Plus side The sex and the swearing didn t bother me Apparently I like books that are more straightforward believable and have lots of profanity more"

"102","The time traveler's wife"," Vavita","really liked it"," The book was nicely written It had enough fantasy and enough romance and didn t push too much neither one nor the other Good balance It was also relly interesting to see how events from past and present intertwined And although you can figure out early on how the story is going to end it is still anenjoyable ride The book is really sad and I cried my eyes out Many times The only thing that bothered me were the characters Clare spends her life waiting for Henry Because she loves him but can you really love a man you ve met when you are I think she idolized him but I don t think she loved him Henry was a mess but at least he grows as a person throughout the book but it takes long Therfore no stars more"

"104","The time traveler's wife"," Ben Babcock","liked it"," Contrary to what the title of this book implies to any sensible reader this book is not about River Song Disappointing I know I ended up liking this book much more than I expected To be perfectly honest I did not want to like The Time Traveler s Wife It s a popular book a pop lit book that has appropriated something so dear to science fiction and turned it into a gimmick for a romance I had resolved to read it so I would know what others are talking about and be armed with reasons why I dislike it But that didn t happen Instead I found myself entranced by the way Audrey Niffenegger has ruthlessly pursued this idea of two lovers literally out of sync with each other She is quick to establish consistent rules about Henry s time travelling and there is a singular pleasure to watching the timeline wrap around itself as we see an event Clare witnessed as a young girl from the eyes of the much older temporally-displaced Henry In short Niffenegger takes what could have been a gimmick and through an obvious effort and maybe even some talent turns it into a great story That s not to say the time travel in this story is perfect After all the reason that Henry travels through time unwillingly is kind of silly it s genetic As if there are certain alleles that somehow cause our bodies to opt out of the space-time continuum On the surface it s an intriguing premise and Niffenegger at least tries to make it sound scientific Nothing but Henry s body travels with him so he always arrives nude as he remarks it s a good thing he doesn t wear glasses But how does this phenomenon know what is part of Henry s body If it s anything with the time-travelling DNA then that would leave behind his hair not to mention all those lovely bacteria on and inside our bodies that keep us alive and healthy Any way you slice it Niffenegger s explanations for Henry s condition are implausible but her attempts at plausibility are sincere enough that I ll be generous and call this science fiction not fantasy It s such a fine line Once we grant Henry his miracle exception to hop through time we can finely immerse ourselves in the story or stories We get to see both Henry and Clare s perspectives of events sometimes of the same events sometimes we even see the perspective from two different Henrys when they meet up This is particularly fascinating during the first part of the novel when Henry recounts the first time he can remember time-travelling and all the times his older self taught him survival tactics pickpocketing fighting etc Randomly materializing in the nude is a dangerous hobby Niffenegger comes up with all of these interesting consequences of Henry s singular ability both for Henry and for the woman he is destined to love Clare meets Henry when she is young six I think but he is already in his forties Henry won t meet the contemporary Clare until he is and she is so for the first two decades of her life Clare must content herself with Henry s sporadic visits to a meadow near her parents luxurious home At the very beginning of the story Henry s visits to Clare are a little creepy naked middle-aged man shows up and begins spending quality time with a young girl Niffenegger lampshades this concern during their first visit but there is still something problematic about the way Clare essentially imprints upon Henry It makes one wonder if either of them had any choice in the matter If there is one deeper theme I d take away from The Time Traveler s Wife it has to be the meditation upon free will act like you have it even if you probably don t Henry talks about how he is unable to change the past how even when he tries he feels constrained somehow I find the description and explanation rather unsatisfying but again credit to Niffenegger for establishing ground rules This means that if he sees his older self do something he is bound to repeat that action when he becomes that person no matter how hard he tries If that is the case it seems to me like Henry s entire life and by extension everyone s lives are predestined Niffenegger doesn t explore this as explicitly as I would like but it is fairly well-developed through the course of the plot itself Henry and Clare s relationship is in many ways like that of the Doctor and River Song The older time traveller appears to a young girl and influences her in a big way she falls in love with him They continue to meet he gets younger and she gets older They have adventures together out of order Both The Time Traveler s Wife and Doctor Who explore how confusing and interesting such a relationship would be and neither shies away from the fact that it s very messed up Henry s presence during Clare s formative years essentially means she has little choice but to fall in love with him Later she finds the contemporary version of him showing him her little diary with all the dates of his visits and tells him they are destined to be together Sometimes I lament our linear existence but I have to say I can see the benefits to having everyone experience events in the same order The Time Traveler s Wife is not quite the sappy romance I feared it would be Henry and Clare s relationship is most of the time genuinely touching I suppose one could complain about the way Clare eternally pines for Henry but I think Niffenegger makes it clear that however the relationship came about in the first place both of them love each other unconditionally Still if it weren t for the time travelling the story would be fairly ho-hum and conventional It s the unchronological nature of events that rescues this book that and occasionally brilliant moments of writing from Niffenegger I particularly loved the mood she captures when Henry is meeting Clare s family for the first time Christmas The squabbling and bickering feels very real even if the supporting characters the oddly stereotypically-dictioned servants do not There is only one major thorn in this otherwise pleasant surprise the ending Specifically the last two acts of the book By this time the novelty of Henry s time-travelling has worn off and we are fast approaching the point where something has to give Nevertheless I was kind of expecting I don t know Something more than what we get Something deeper more meaningful I m not going to spoil it but essentially my problem is that there are no surprises in store for us it does happen exactly the way Henry tells us it will happen I wasn t hoping for a last-minute reprieve but I put the book down without any sense of being changed for it And that to me is unsatisfying So I don t quite think The Time Traveler s Wife deserves all its accolades but maybe that s just me It s a good book one that I enjoyed and one that I wouldn t hesitate to recommend to certain people What could easily have been a poorly-executed gimmick is actually the core of the book Yet for all the big issues raised by time travel like free will this book remains a stubborn biography of two people rather than slipping loose to become something bigger I was party to the experience of The Time Traveler s Wife but not really part of the experience more"

"107","The time traveler's wife"," Anne Valerie","really liked it"," This book is a debut for Audrey Niffenegger And being a first-timer herself i think she made the complex timelines with ease The Time Traveler s Wife is a love story concealed inside a suspense novel but is far from a science fiction exploration of the space-time continuum The book is about the two characters - Henry DeTamble and Clare Abshire whose passionate love affair endures across a sea of time and captures themselves in an impossibly romantic trap Henry is a time-traveller a genetic mutation which causes him to spontaneously travel through time disappearing from view leaving behind his clothes and possessions and arriving naked in another time and another place While Clare is leaving a chronologically normal life Henry isn t After their first meeting Clare was and Henry would be Clare will always wait for his arrival She has known him all her life He visits her numerous times during her childhood and adolescence and inadvertently reveals that they will be married in the future His last visit is on her th birthday in and will be separated for two years Finally they meet in a real time for both of them Clare is and Henry is Henry does not know anything about Clare and Clare has to show Henry the diary she made as a testament of Henry s existence in Clare s past which is still in Henry s future Henry begins to experience the events in Clare s childhood and at the same time experiencing life with the adult Clare in the present In the novel the future cannot be changed and many tragic events are foreshadowed in the past When they soon get married Clare and Henry have to struggle to survive and maintain their love and at the same time fighting a complex disorder that constantly threatens their existence They yearn for the domestic drudgery and the homely comforts of marriage without the constant fear of separation He longs to be able to live only in the present and he and Clare desperately search for a medical treatment for the disorder but to no avail Although the love in the story is very much appalling and intense a part of it I find ultimately depressing Henry s father never recovers and continues to mourn for years when his mother died and Ingrid Henry s ex-girlfriend committed suicide after losing Henry to Clare The love in the story has such a passion with no middle ground no growth from the experience But my most favorite part is the way Henry describes love through his letter to Clare This is how it goes Clare I want to tell you again I love you Our love has been the thread through a labyrinth the net under the high-wire walker the only real thing in this strange life of mine that I could ever trust Tonight I feel that my love for you has more density in this world than I do as though I could linger on after me and surround you keep you hold you more"
"108","The time traveler's wife"," Elizabeth","liked it"," This is one of those novels that sort of dazzles you with pretty words and imagery and you find yourself raving to all your friends about how good it is but every now and then you read certain parts and think about how truly dull or pretentious the characters are or how some things don t really sit right with you - I mean why does the Abshire family employ five black servants And wow there are a lot of punk bands and obscure artists being listed and I feel kind of stupid because I m not really familiar with any of this but my God for some reason it s so good and I can t stop reading and everyone needs to know about this book And then it ends in a really distressing fashion And you think about how much you liked the book if only it had ended differently But then you start to realise there were actually a great many things you didn t like and it makes you wonder if it was any good at all There is nothing more unsettling to me than a woman whose entire life revolves around a man And in the case of Clare Abshire it is literally her entire life She meets Henry for the first time when she is years old and that s it He is everything to her from then on I think she pretended to be interested in art at some point but I didn t really buy it She wasn t really anybody She didn t really have ideas or interests or a personality because her one goal in life was to be Henry s wife -Henry at least was a little bit more interesting because he lived for almost years without knowing her and sometimes he made funny jokes - and so in the end when he is removed from her she has nothing She doesn t even really seem to remember that she has a child And she waits for him until she is old and grey and it s very Titanic and pathetic and depressing There s a point at which Henry himself hopes Claire will be okay once she learns view spoiler about his imminent death hide spoiler and then says but I know she won t be Also view spoiler quite early on Henry tells Claire how he depends on his feet and if he were ever to lose his feet she might as well shoot him And then at the end of the book he loses his feet and dies from a gunshot wound And the foreshadowing just seemed a bit too obvious I mean I whole heartedly agree that if my feet were ever to be amputated I would like to be shot and put out of my misery but it would never occur to me in a million years to put those words in a sentence and say them out loud hide spoiler So random So yeah I mean it s a decent read but it s like a false decent read Bells and whistles and the Violent Femmes more"
"109","The time traveler's wife"," Jacob",""," November It s a good book with a very interesting idea and a fascinating story--and beautiful haunting imagery as well--and it calls up tricky questions about fate and free will But the author takes an awesome idea involuntary time travel and just bogs it down with as much dull description of food and sex and music and art as she possibly can There s just too much of the book as if Niffenegger wrote every Henry-Claire-Henry-Henry scene combination she could imagine although to be frank I wouldn t have minded some more Henry-on-Henry action but that s just me and kept them all no matter how convoluted and bloated the book especially the middle got After a while we get page after page of Henry here Henry there Henry now and then Interesting sure but it could ve been trimmed a bit maybe excised to focus instead on how or why Henry and Claire could possibly stay together without once questioning--seriously--if they really love each other or if they re just going through the motions because they think they have to They don t think about it they don t question it and there don t appear to be any rules in play frankly if I was in present-Henry s situation I d feel a bit strange about letting a future- or past-me get frisky with present-Claire but that s just me being chronomonogamous Overall the relationship feels slightly shallow as if they d rather let the universe figure things out for them while they have sex and eat food If that s what you re into there s lots of it And time-traveling Can t forget that bit And as for the narrative voice it would ve been nice to be able to read the book without double-checking to remind myself who was narrating at various points Claire and Henry sounded exactly the same--and in a story that often includes more than one copy of any individual character that tends to get annoying fast All in all though it s a lovely story But it could have been better Oh it could have been so much better more"
"110","The time traveler's wife"," Jess The Bookworm","really liked it"," Henry meets Clare when he is thirty six and Clare is six and they get married when Henry is thirty one and Clare is twenty three This is possible because Henry is a time traveller He suffers from an affliction where he time travels without being able to control it turning up in different times and places completely naked as he cannot take anything with him when he travels What I liked about this book I enjoyed Clare and Henry s relationship It was a good look into some of the troubles that a marriage can encounter Even if two people are meant to be they will still suffer hardships and it doesn t mean that everything will be smooth sailing The book left me feeling quite emotional about these two characters I enjoyed the time travel aspect and how it was woven into the story with an attempt at a medical explanation What I didn t like it felt a bit creepy at times with Henry meeting up with Clare naked when he was older and she was a young girl I know that it was kept PG at these points but still had a creepy element all the same I also didn t quite warm to Henry as much as I should have in a romantic novel I was constantly left feeling that he wasn t very healthy for Clare at all Otherwise I enjoyed this page turner of a novel and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance novels with a bit of a twist more"

nuova - serie televisiva ma io non ci potevo non vedere il Dottore e Amelia Pound the girl who waited e River Song the Doctor wife Lo so lo so stata una deformazione sciocca che mi ha fatto vedere l intero romanzo in un ottica diversa diciamo pure che senza nemmeno aver cominciato a conoscerli sentivo gi una spiccata affinit con i personaggi Tutto questo per dire che se dovessi cadere in qualche scivolone di valutazione il motivo presto detto Veniamo quindi a noi Henry il nostro uomo il nostro viaggiatore del tempo Ma qui non abbiamo Tardis n Vortex qui il viaggiare nel tempo un anomalia no vabb parlo proprio come una whovians una specie di malattia Non controlli il tuo passaggio nelle epoche non sai quando avver non sai per quanto tempo durer e non sai in quale tempo arriverai Sai solo che te lo devi aspettare prima o poi Insomma si tratta di una patologia con un nome specifico cronoalterazione In uno di questi salti perch insomma il viaggio una cosa pi pianificata e Henry non ha il tempo di programmare nulla incontra Clare quella che diventer sua moglie ma che al momento solo una ragazzina di sei anni Lei non lo conosce - non ancora - ma lui s e di lei sa tutto persino come prende il caff E tuttavia verr un tempo in cui sar Clare a conoscere lui ma lui non conoscer ancora lei E ci sar un tempo in cui un Henry trentenne insegnar al piccolo se stesso a borseggiare o un tempo in cui due quindicenni due Henry si divertiranno assieme Intricato Eheh questi sono i viaggi nel tempo Disse qualcuno una volta People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect but actually from a non-linear non-subjective viewpoint - it s more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly time-y wimey stuff La gente pensa che il tempo sia una mera progressione da causa a effetto ma in realt da un punto di vista non lineare non soggettivo pi come una grossa palla di traballante traballosa temporaleggiante cosa Qui per il tempo non si cambia Ogni cosa gi scritta e ogni momento - presente passato o futuro - importante fondamentale e s anche unico nonostante si riviva una due tre cento volte Insomma una storia che va letta con attenzione perch gli sbalzi temporali non sono solo per Henry che frastornato e nudo deve affrontare un nuovo tempo ma anche per il lettore che deve rabberciare la storia seguendo due punti di vista diversi disseminati in diverse epoche temporali Quindi soffermandoci un attimo su questo cambio di narratore direi che ben fatto si poteva far meglio vero ma il risultato globale accettabile La differenza tra Henry e Clare narratore si avverte pi in certi passaggi meno in altri In alcuni paragrafi dopo aver preso confidenza con lo stile dei personaggi non si fa difficolt a capire chi sta parlando in altri tuttavia le indicazioni all inizio aiutano a individuare il narratore Sempre con riguardo al passaggio di narratore in narratore ho appezzato molto la differenza tra Clare bambina e Clare donna Henry pi un corpo unico nella narrazione scelta coerente considerando che per lui il tempo si muove in maniera diversa Per fare un esempio la Clare di sei anni racconta e racconta la punteggiatura scarsa come se si trattasse di un discorso fatto di getto con un unico respiro un po come quando un bambino entusiasta di qualcosa ha foga nel raccontarla a un adulto si sofferma su particolari inutili mentre la Clare pi matura pi posata capace di descrivere gli avvenimenti con pi calma e precisione L intreccio quindi si regge essenzialmente sui due poli di questa storia d amore sui generis con Henry e Clare in veste di moderni Ulisse e Penelope Gli altri personaggi ci sono e non ci sono Il comparto affettivo di Henry sicuramente pi curato rispetto a quello di Clare e del vasto gruppo di amici se ne contano solo un paio a cui viene prestata pi attenzione e qualche scena in pi rispetto agli altri Tuttavia non si pu parlare di un approfondimento vero e proprio perch l obiettivo del narratore sempre fissato su questa strana coppia temporale Infatti la loro storia per certi aspetti gi passata ma un altra parte ancora in costruzione e questo dislivello di esperienze e percezioni e ricordi passati presenti e futuri tra i due protagonisti sicuramente un aspetto molto affascinante Sotto certi aspetti tuttavia mi aspettavo una trama pi complessa intrecciata saldamente a balzi e paradossi temporali come se tutto fosse in continua mutazione invece qui la vicenda un po statica e predestinata Apprezzo come ho gi scritto l idea di partenza cosa che mi ha fatto propendere per un voto pi generoso ma mi resta qualche dubbio sulla realizzazione La scelta di avere un passato e un futuro saldamente intrecciati lascia poco spazio alla suspance con la conseguenza che la parte centrale del libro abbastanza stagnante Forse si sarebbero ottenuti maggiori risultati eliminando qualche scena inutile che non aggiunge davvero nulla alla narrazione e riducendo cos il numero di pagine Ci non toglie comunque una conclusione toccante e un messaggio profondo vivere ogni istante come se fosse unico dall altra parte per forse un po pessimistico non importa ci che fai perch il tuo destino gi tutto scritto Ah Un piccolo consiglio non leggere la quarta di copertina oppure leggine solo le prime sei sette righe perch dopo c uno spoiler bello grosso che ti leva una buona parte della tensione nella seconda met del romanzo Solitamente come sai difficile che io legga le quarte ma qui mi son detta eh via sono a met del libro guardiamo come viene riassunto qui il romanzo dannata curiosit Ovvio che la mia sia stata una scelta sbagliatissima pensare che se avessi aspettato qualche pagina non sarebbe successo nulla more"
"118","The time traveler's wife"," Shelby M Read and Find Out","did not like it"," Here s my spoiler-filled rant video For the most part I did not like this book I continued reading this because I wanted to see how it would end up and because I wanted to complete it for Tome Topple And I found the ending to be anticlimactic So this review is mostly going to be things that I didn t like which I ll put in a list format with spoiler sections Also triggers in this book for cheating relationships The romance It may sound silly to say that I found something that revolves around time travel to be unbelievable because of course time travel is unbelievable But it was It manages to combine the tropes of lifelong love and insta-love at the same time view spoiler In different ways both Henry and Clare are groomed to love each other by each other without there being any natural falling in love Which I found almost creepy Also I know that when Henry is seeing Clare as a child and teenager that she will eventually be his wife and her present self is his wife But the romance between a something man and a teenage girl was still just unnerving to me hide spoiler I love time travel but this book made it look ridiculous Which I guess it kind of is but still Disappointing There were too many times where Henry s time traveling or something fishy should have been really obvious to various characters and yet they don t seem to realize anything is going on We re often spoiled for what s going to happen in each character s future because of the time traveling which made me care a lot less when the event actually happened view spoiler Henry s death It had been spoken of so many times by the time that it actually happened that I just felt indifferent and just wanted it to be over with I m the kind of person who doesn t enjoy a book as much if the surprises are taken away during the reading experience hide spoiler Random unexplained bits of Henry s personality and behavior view spoiler like him being chaotic and ruining people s lives or enjoying violence too much hide spoiler There were things that he would do or express when he was young that seemed to just suddenly go away when he was older without any real explanation for the personality change Gomez I hate Gomez and knew it from the moment he first showed up in the book I don t think it s cute or protective when male characters are possessive of female characters view spoiler Though I was disappointed in Clare for sleeping with Gomez twice once when he was dating Charisse and another time after they were married I was completely disgusted by Gomez himself for cheating on his partner not seeming to feel remorse for it not telling her and just sticking with her while being in live with her friend It made me SO MAD And Henry and Gomez are supposedly good friends I don t get that Gomez was waiting around for Henry to die so he could have a go at Clare Good Lord hide spoiler I know this is romance but I hate erotic language SO MUCH view spoiler I was less than pages into the book and reading words like cock and ridiculous similes about erections I just couldn t deal with it hide spoiler Stereotyped language usage for characters of color Enough said Too much name dropping and description Normally I would love descriptive writing but for this book it was just distracting There are CONSTANT references to street names and artists and French phrases that I don t know of and that in this book I did not care to look up Privilege As a newlywed myself I got married last year I understand getting accustomed to day to day life figuring out who does what chores etc But for Henry and Clare apparently neither of them are willing to vacuum so they hire a cleaning service OK what He s a librarian she s an artist Where are they getting the dough to hire a someone to clean their place Is this because of Clare s privileged family background Probably Clare view spoiler My intense dislike of Clare really got started when they were trying to conceive a child I can understand how traumatizing a series of miscarriages must be and I can understand wanting to have a child anyway despite the risk But then there comes the conversation they have after her fourth miscarriage when Henry suggests that they adopt a child And Clare s response But that would be fake It would be pretending I m sick of pretending We pretend all the time I want to really do this This made me very very angry I am interested in adopting and birthing children of my own I know people who were adopted and have adopted These comments and this mindset actually made me sick and it was at this point that I realized I couldn t really enjoy Clare as a character hide spoiler I ll stop my list here but I ll say this the ending No view spoiler Clare apparently spends her old age dressing in the same way sitting in the same place doing the same thing just waiting for her last glance at Henry How does this hamper her ability to enjoy the last years of her life hide spoiler Suffice it to say I will be unhauling this book I don t think I regret reading it though because I just generally don t regret reading more"
"119","The time traveler's wife"," Jayaprakash Satyamurthy","did not like it"," I only read this one because it was there on a shelf at home and my wife made carefully non-committal statements about it It was as bad as I d feared it would be when I first heard about it Momentarily fascinating fleetingly promising and then thuddingly ploddingly tedious is this story of Henry the impossibly cool and versatile librarian punk rock enthusiast son of a famous dead opera singing mother and alcoholic second violin father In other words one of those annoying hipster Hornby-eque protags except that he is chronologically displaced he has a genetic quirk that makes his suddenly leap back or forth in time at times of great stress or just in general for no real reason It s also the story of Clare impossibly beautiful and talented paper-making artist who meets Henry at various points in her life from the ages of and as he keeps travelling back in time to convince her that they are to marry Finally they meet in their own shared time line and marry There are moments when it seems interesting - mostly when Henry is meeting his own younger selves and they talk about the meaning of it all wither freewill c But once the love story takes over it is like every terrible romantic movie ever made rolled into one There s the awkward Xmas with the wealthy parents of the girl I thought I was reading a novelisation of Meet The Parents when Clare s white bread family finds out Henry is half Jewish There s the broken old father finding new hope in life thanks to his wonderful new daughter in law The cool friends They go to a Violent Femmes concert and dance and Clare confronts Henry s ex to jump-cuts of lyric scraps Their struggle to have a child against all the odds Clare s nightmares after losing her mother after her miscarriages Henry s nightmares of his penis falling off after he loses his feet in a terrible accident Has Audrey Niffenegger never met a cliche she didn t love This is one of those books that is so absorbed in giving the main characters complex personas and biogs that it forgets to give them souls I couldn t care for or relate to a man who is supposed to have lived before marriage in a flat that was a sofa a bed and books just like I used to That s quite an achievement on the author s part and a mark of how little her characters came to life in a manner that made sense given all the attributes she attached to them Her characters are so nondescript under all the minutiae that one can barely distinguish between Henry and Clare s first-person narratives which keep alternating throughout the novel Note to Niffenegger If you can t pull off different narrative voices just write in in third-person omniscient next time okay Most of all the story becomes creepier the more you think about it How do we even know that Henry and Clare would ever have married if Henry hadn t brainwashed her into loving him throughout her childhood and adolescence He makes Humbert Humbert seem like Mother Teresa once you accept the possibility that he has simply obsessed over a woman he once met time-travelled to her past and manipulated her into becoming his wife Go back and re-read this book with this scenario in mind It makes incredible amounts of sense A supremely unsavoury narrative of predation and mind-rape hidden in what people including the author seem to imagine is a love story Better yet don t even bother reading it the first time To my extreme relief my wife later told me that she didn t like the book at all but wanted me to draw my own conclusions She s probably considerably more of a sadist than I realised at first but at least neither of us is a time-traveller To sum up Borges once said there is no need to write -page novels whose core idea can be summed up in a few minutes How one wishes Niffenegger had heard and heeded his words more"
"120","The time traveler's wife"," Amanda","it was ok"," What to say I guess I d categorize this book as an enjoyable disappointment The premise is really interesting and the story itself is ridiculously engrossing but the flaws are so glaring that I wouldn t call this a good book The writing isn t bad it s just there it tells the story and nothing else and at times I found myself skimming For such a long book the characters are quite flat and sometimes they did and said such unrealistic things that I laughed in disbelief The supporting characters in particular are really just thin sketches largely forgotten about until the next time they need to impact the storyline In addition the major themes are woefully underdeveloped and are never explored enough to make any sort of impact or produce any uh deep thoughts What could have been a nice exploration of free will is reduced to a few pretentious conversations between the main characters and a couple of lines here and there buried between hundreds and hundreds of pages A distant alcoholic father that has squandered his life is clearly supposed to be part of another underlying theme though these interactions are never fleshed out completely what the reader is left with is a feeling of being simultaneously being hit over the head with something after the th mention of how the father s life was squandered and still having it be underdeveloped because we re just told something and never really sufficiently shown it The book is clearly getting at something a lot of somethings maybe but it never quite gets to any of them it gets close to some big issues then seems to lose steam and double back towards one of its many unfortunate Nicholas Sparks-esque schlock moments I admit that I am largely intolerant of hearing about how anyone is fated to be with someone else Yet I liked reading it I freely admit that I cried quite a bit during the ending which is almost unbearably sad For all its flaws I felt positive about the book after reading it like I said it s a really engrossing story Apparently it s about to be made into a movie which should be interesting All in all I think most people would enjoy reading this book though it doesn t quite live up to the Best book evAAAAAArrr hype it s received more"
"121","The time traveler's wife"," Linda","really liked it"," As usual I am out of sync with the mainstream I give this one four stars but it could have been a lot better than it actually was At first I was taken in by the science fiction aspect of the book but I couldn t stop asking myself questions If the time travel was more likely to occur during times of stress why didn t Henry time travel when he was in school It seemed like an impossible secret to keep over a lifetime I didn t like at all that view spoiler Henry seemed to be attracted to Clare at the ages of eleven and thirteen It made me uncomfortable to read it Just when I was getting over that there was the business about the first kiss A grown man aggressively kissing a fifteen year old is seriously wrong I didn t see Clare and Henry s relationship as a beautiful love story Another problem for me was that elements of the plot just didn t jive Clare and Henry commit assault and battery For a good reason mind you but it was unrealistic to think that there were no repercussions at all for Clare s attacker or for Clare The gene explanation for Henry s time travel was silly hide spoiler The biggest problem that I had with this book was that Niffenegger just had too much to say about too many different topics She wanted to talk about God destiny love music religion It felt like Niffenegger tried to put every opinion she ever had about everything under the sun in this one book With so much bad to say why do I give it four stars The answer is simple-the writing The mechanics of word choice and sentence structure is good Also the plot was interesting Even when the book was a depressing mess I wanted to know what was going to happen There is a lot about this book to criticize that I haven t even mentioned but there is something special about it Niffenegger hints at greatness and when she can t deliver it is really disappointing but that doesn t mean the book is bad I generally dislike the romance genre but this book kept my interest from start to finish so ultimately I would recommend to give it a try more"
"122","The time traveler's wife"," Carolyn Storer","liked it"," StarsI found the book to be well written poignant and heart-warming I sympathised with the main characters Henry and Clare and enjoyed the blossoming relationship between them I liked the fact that the author used the present tense and first person narrative as it enabled me to connect with the characters straight away and to really get inside their heads I don t think this would have been as easy if it was past tense or third person However for me there is hardly anything so fascinating and yet so utterly frustrating as the Time Travel story and frustration can sometimes be the stronger emotion due to the vaguely spelled out theory of time travel which often leads to events being confusing and contradictory This is what I think happened in this book I m not particularly scientifically minded but I am intrigued by the subject of time-travel and I know this book is a work fiction but I always find time travel a difficult one as there s always the Time Travel paradox I found that the contradictions of time travel interfered with my total immersion in the book As there are several Henry s traveling through time and we know this by the fact that he sometimes visits himself and watches them time travel then surely all these Henry s would be meeting with Clare and therefore she would be inundated with them I know that I should have put aside trying to analyse this element of the book as time travel is only theory but I couldn t and so it hindered my enjoyment of the book slightly However overall I did enjoy the story and found it to be sweet and the characters likable I would recommend it but be warned put your time traveling theories aside and just go with the flow If you enjoy a good love story then this is the book for you more"
"123","The time traveler's wife"," Yesha","liked it"," Well I have neutral feeling for this book First half of the book is fun some incidents and situations are funny and interesting Books arts music food all in one book Dates and time and ages mentioned before every chapter helped Events like Clare s childhood her longing for child Alba s meetings to Henry in time travel are best in book It s too long book Too slow after Alba s birth I am still not clear on Why is Henry going in past in Clare s childhood and creating her life I mean fixing the future in her mind And why is it that Clare remembers everything of her childhood and meetings with Henry and Henry doesn t remember that specific part while he remembers other time travels very well Henry s death made me feel pity rather than sad I would have liked it more if his character was more strong more"

"137","The time traveler's wife"," Dorlana","liked it"," I loved it and I hated it The writing style that I found brilliant in the beginning became jumbled and manic to me by the middle of the book It was a roller coaster not because it kept me at the edge of my seat but because it had waves of excitement and then went down hill to where I almost wanted to get off boring or depressing parts and then it slowly brought me back up and grabbed my interest enough until the next dip I had actually put it down at one point Parents might want to read it before handing it over to their preteens and teens I m not sorry I read it It was unique well thought out and had very alive characters One thing I find interesting is that I wanted to watch the movie right up until I read the Fragments chapter And I just hate that this book that I loved at the beginning left me feeling icky by the end more"

"142","The time traveler's wife"," Apokripos","really liked it"," A Love to Defy the Rules of Time A Book Review of Audrey Niffenegger s The Time Traveler s Wife Right from the beginning of Audrey Niffeneger s famed debut novel The Time Traveler s Wife the reader is already thrown terrifically off-balanced Here s a scenario of a man meets woman that s anything but and a love story while on the surface conquers the test of time challenges its tenets as well On the day that Henry DeTamble a librarian meets Clare Anne Abshire an art student in a Chicago library it seems she had already known him all his life while he doesn t even know who she is As the reader gets to know bit by bit Henry is afflicted with Chrono-Displacement Disorder a genetic anomaly that makes him involuntarily displaced in time triggered mostly during moments of emotional stress That s how Clare had met him by means of an older future version of Henry who traveled back in time to meet the child Clare where in her past they first fell in love while in the present time of their meeting all of this is just waiting to unfold Wait am I talking sense Well talk about being off-balanced for that s just how I felt reading the first chapter of the book yet as I continued on shuffling through different timelines in the life of this couple things begin to click in and become comprehensible and I was left impressed by Niffenegger s unusual love story and her atypical take on time traveling I think this is one of those books that have something for everyone it quite engages the reader on multiple levels For the most part some easily relate to the circumstances of Henry and Clare s relationship that though Henry is beset by a strange medical condition the daily ordeals and simple joys they undergo as a couple and in their eventual married life remains grounded in the same experiences when two people are madly in love with each other For sci-fi buffs Niffenegger s rendition of one of the genre s most often used concept is refreshing taking time traveling on its head and portraying it as something that s uncontrollable a threat to constancy and a blight I fairly marveled at Niffenegger s clever fusion of this sci-fi element into a heartfelt love story themes such as waiting domesticity relationship gender roles fate and free will as well as brushing on philosophical questions of meaning and purpose By figuring out time traveling into the tale of Henry and Clare she also gives us a peek into that window of a wild fantasy some of us seem to share what is it like to go into the past and even the childhood of our significant other It gives more than an adequate meaning of what s like to be a part of someone s life More than anything else the novel s quaint structure through Niffenegger s innovative space time continuum interplay sure does give that sense of displacement to the reader that Henry must have felt as it hurls and jumps from certain events in the lives of her two major protagonists slogging through different chronologies Yet for once didn t I felt lost for the author excellently laid out the logic of her premise clearly in the beginning pages of the book though frankly it was a slow start for me as I take it all in locks her narrative and once you get settled in the rest ambles by smoothly at least for me The effect is a truly moving novel that even when the execution falls short its raw imaginative and intellectual power carries the day The only problem that I have with this book is that it s too long and it could ve do some good to the narrative if it was cut in some parts especially in its middle section that kind of plateaued where some of the chapters served as fillers and doesn t even bear a connection to and figure in whatsoever into what will eventually happen in the novel s climax I also noted that it was mostly on this section that some of its melodramatic stuff comes on in excess with copiously inconsequential sex scenes and where the line of relationships of the novel s key players goes overboard it made me roll my eyes as I think Niffenegger s brewing a storm in a small tea cup adding complication in the plot that in the first place it can do without Despite occasionally verging on the histrionic the characters are well-drawn with complicated family history and close sometimes too much for comfort oh there I m at again friendships The dialogue is witty but not unnatural I particularly like some of the parts from Clare s perspective which balances the suspension of disbelief the reader needs to accept its sci-fi premise Book Details Book for Published by Harcourt Inc Trade Paperback Edition pagesStarted August Finished August My Rating See this review on my book blog Dark Chest of Wonders and for many others more"

"145","The time traveler's wife"," Jaylia","it was amazing"," Original review Time travel fiction that is actually well written review update after an audiobook reread Typically the time travel novels I am most drawn to send a contemporary character back or less often forward in time to some interesting historical era where that character has to cope with differences in culture and lifestyle while trying to accomplish some kind of quest--even if it s just to get back home--allowing me to effortlessly glean fascinating insights about a time gone by The Time Traveler s Wife of course is nothing like this and yet it is maybe my favorite book in the genre Henry a punk music loving librarian and Clare an artist who creates large sculptures of paper are people I would love to read about in any story and I enjoy almost as much the rich cast of well-drawn supporting characters many of whom could probably star in their own books It s Henry who is jolted around in time and it s just as brutal as it sounds because he is abruptly jerked from wherever he is and dropped naked somewhere else in time usually some time in his own past though occasionally in his future To survive these circumstances Henry has had to become good at running picking locks fighting lying and stealing The plot examines the what if of being involuntarily shoved back and forth in time away from your present--including the paradoxes of meeting past and future versions of yourself--and combines that with the affecting story of two lovers who meet each other out of sequence the normal chronology of a relationship upended When Henry first sees Clare in his mid-twenties Clare has already known Henry since she was six because older Henrys have been inadvertently time traveling into the field behind her parent s home and visiting with her almost all her life Ever since I first read The Time Traveler s Wife in it has been on my mental list of all-time best reads a book I judge other novels by and it has maintained a prominent place on my bookshelf For this reread I listened to the audio version and was just as entranced by the story as I was in my initial encounter Because it s narrated by two talented readers a Henry and a Clare who both really capture their characters I was able to especially savor the language and writing style Being audio also meant no skimming over details when there is some sadness at the end adding a little not unwelcome poignancy to my pleasure A sequel featuring Alba Henry and Clare s time traveling daughter is set to come out sometime soon Can t wait--here s hoping it s just as wonderful more"

"148","The time traveler's wife"," Malvina","it was ok"," I took this book with me on vacation as a beach read and ended up reading it in two days - day I was intrigued by the story and was enjoying the book about pages day I was bored out of my mind and ended up skimming the rest I liked the first chunk of the story because it felt fresh and new to me Also the parts when Clare was a child and Henry in his s was so creepy and weird that I was pulled in Then the story dragged on and on I felt like half of the book was filler with nothing happening I m not someone who needs a book filled with plot but this one didn t offer anything in the filler pages It didn t go into character depth or anything that made me think It went from scene to scene where Henry and Clare are either eating having social events with friends and family or having sex All of it felt empty and meaningless because you could essentially cut the scene out and it wouldn t change anything in the book The characters were so in love with each other but I never understood why I was told by the author that they were but it was not actually shown Sure they had scenes together where they discussed their love and did some romantic stuff but none of it had enough depth to convince me Another problem I had with the book was the writing I thought it was awful - truly truly bad The author wrote in these short and incredibly simplistic sentences that it felt like a year old girl wrote them I d give some examples but I left it at the resort - I had no interest in returning that clunker home Her sentences were something like this Clare sat on the couch Henry poured himself a drink Gomez raised his eyebrow at Henry Clare told Henry not to drink That is essentially how she wrote the entire novel After the novelty of the time traveling story wore off on me I struggled to get through it because it felt so pointless and quite frankly badly written more"
"149","The time traveler's wife"," Lucy","really liked it"," I originally read this about five years ago when it was a super popular best seller and absolutely loved it I recall recommending it freely only to be chagrined later on with the realization that the book is really not intended for the sensitive reader With my first reading Niffenegger managed to smoke and mirror her way around the book s frequent crude language and descriptive love scenes because Time Traveler s plot was so incredibly original After attempting a discussion with a friend who very recently read it I realized most of my memory of the book was too faded for a legitimate conversation I picked up the enormous hardbound copy at the library and quickly found myself escaping in the tricky time traveling romance and doomed love story once again It really is such a fantastic idea and when I finished I found myself still scratching my head in wonder about how Niffenegger got the idea for this book in the first place and feeling slightly overwhelmed by its desperate ending The smoke and mirrors weren t as effective the second time around however as I felt more offended by the crude language used by both Clare and Henry I m not a prude who regards all language as inappropriate and think sometimes the character s background or emotional outburst warrants the feeling such language manages to evoke But it felt really unnecessary most of the time Clare and Henry are both such smart characters so capable of better verbs and adjectives Additionally neither seems particularly rash or impetuous - so their casual dropping of vulgar words only seemed vulgar If you care about those things you probably won t enjoy this book If you can justify looking past it to read a story unlike anything you ve ever read you might just love this book I did more"

"154","The time traveler's wife"," Chris","it was ok"," So I very much wanted to like this book The premise seamed very available to becoming a compelling and interesting book However I feel that the author has gotten caught up in the fad of raw writing and the idea that this is the pinnacle of all that one can do This is what MFA programs seem to favor these days and I guess what is the new fashion in writing But this idea is often confused and this author has mistaken vulgar for raw and real For example Clarie refers to her genitals as my cunt a few times This seems a term that most if not all women would avoid naming their genitals What s more often this book seemed smarmy and lecherous The idea that a Claire and Henry have a healthy love affair after he has been the focus of her youth and adolescences is at best uncomfortable Again I believe this is an attempt to make it more raw and challenge conventions But for me it seemed a cheap ploy which attempts to elicit a reaction from the reader to make the reader uncomfortable and not to actually suggest anything real My two cents for what they are worth more"

"171","The time traveler's wife"," Eunice","really liked it"," Ugh how can I start this review Well this is my second time to finish The Time Traveler s Wife and still I almost cried It s heart-breaking and wrenching but the thing is it will leave you the idea of FOREVER Yes there s a FOREVER The Time Traveler s Wife is a debut novel of Audrey Niffenegger which is a sci-fi romance It is about a man named Henry who is for some scientific reason can time travel apparently everyone would know that based on the title The story begins when Henry met Clare at the age of six while he is thirty-six Henry can be at different times without him wanting it and it seems like this surreal sickness or whatever someone would consider it is the cause of everything As Clare and Henry ride their journey of love time traveling will halt them to live a normal life I d be more subjective with this review At first I was so confused with the time setting But as I read on I learned how to cope up with it And it is as if I was also time traveling I like how the story was written because it is in two POVs it s Clare s and Henry s Knowing what their thinking made me understand the story better Plus I was able to relate in what they re feeling When it comes to the setting s oh well it s very peculiar I mean since Henry can time travel you d see him in different places But what I like the most is of course the meadow where it all began I can picture in my mind how everything happened romantically in the meadow Every time they re in that place I smiled because they re so sweet There s no need to state who my fave characters are It s very obvious But who I like the most is Alba Her attitude is astounding and to have a child like her would definitely be perfect Oh but I hope not a time traveler because though it d be amazing it d be really difficult LOL XDI know I ve said that it s heart-breaking but at the same time this kind of love story can be a proof that no matter what happens if someone really loves you he d be willing to sacrifice everything While reading this novel I was thinking if what if I could time travel That would be really cool and I have the ability to forewarn my loved ones with what is about to happen but of course there d be consequences What is really noteworthy for me is the fact that Clare loved Henry despite of the hindrance to live a normal life And the latter chapters The ENDING Ohmigod I sobbed T was really a beautiful catastrophe I was imagining if this would happen in real life I don t know if this would chaos or peace I JUST DON T KNOW I also like how the story had been attached to science and philosophy Opposite really attracts because I ve seen in this story how well the science and religion blended peacefully The impossibility has become a possibility I also like the cover of the book because it really says a lot It s cute and at the same time it s very meaningful Oh I know this would be unnecessary but it s lack of some remarkable lines Some unforgettable quotes that I would be tempted to post on my blogs or something If that makes sense XDBut still it s stars for me No wonder this had become a movie and I wanna watch it yep I haven t watched it XP I recommend this book to those who love the idea of great love and time-traveling more"
"172","The time traveler's wife"," Serena","did not like it"," This review has been hidden because it contains spoilers To view it click here I put this book on hold in the library and for a year I waited Perhaps that was the downfall of my opinion of this book because in that time I waited my expectations grew for this novel The praise surrounding it was deafening not to mention the fact that the movie was one of the movies I had wanted to see that year I finally got my hands on this book and when I began reading it my heart sank with every page The writing was meh I don t understand why there s so much praise for Niffenegge I put this book on hold in the library and for a year I waited Perhaps that was the downfall of my opinion of this book because in that time I waited my expectations grew for this novel The praise surrounding it was deafening not to mention the fact that the movie was one of the movies I had wanted to see that year I finally got my hands on this book and when I began reading it my heart sank with every page The writing was meh I don t understand why there s so much praise for Niffenegger s writing skills since I ve read young adult books with better writing heck fanfiction with better writing The characters of Clare and Henry were highly dislikeable I m not a cold-hearted person I root for my characters I scream profanities at the antagonists yet I did neither for this book The beginning was awkward the dinner scene with Clare dumping shitloads of plot on an oblivious Henry and the development of Clare and Henry s relationship could have been improved too much sex Furthermore Henry s encounters with a youthful Clare were just plain weird I just don t see how Clare could have fallen in love with Henry who was literally years older than her at the time What five years old sees a naked man appear in their backyard and just accepts it the way Clare does The aforementioned annoyances were bearable the side characters however were not It seems that the author thought that as long as she had Clare and Henry be somewhat three dimensional and she was even lacking on that the other characters could get a free ride It was painful to read the descriptions of the other characters especially the minorities who were beyond stereotypical vivacious larger-than-life black cook and a loving korean landlord with an accent The love square of Clare-Henry-Gomez-Charisse was annoying and useless Gomez has sex and then marries Charisse all the while in love with Clare Charisse knows Gomez loves Clare and stays with Gomez regardless and even has kids with this lowlife And Clare sweet Bella-like Clare kisses Gomez even though she knew that was her best friend s husband right there That s real friendship Oh and the only male gay character in the novel has AIDS Yep defying stereotypes one at time The sex in this book also surprised me I m all for romance and sex when appropriate but it got to a point where Clare and Henry would be having an introspective conversation and Clare would reach for Henry s dick randomly or Henry would be groping Clare s boobs Perhaps Niffenegger wanted to portray them more realistically but it was hard to take these characters seriously with them fucking every few pages It was almost as if they weren t emotionally attached but rather just physically attracted The book got a tad better in the second half but that was only because the characters were slightly more mature and were put into situations that squeezed every drop of sympathy from the reader Unfortunately I was not attached whatsoever to these characters by that time and thus the ending had little effect on me Overall I highly disliked the book The premise was good but otherwise the writing was sloppy and the characters irritated me to no end more"

"174","The time traveler's wife"," Ruth Browne","really liked it"," I ve just read some very harsh reviews of this book here on Goodreads The clash with my own immediate impression which was overwhelmingly good has left me a little queasy The criticisms are totally on point the marginalisation of people of colour and anyone below the prescribed tax-bracket the cataloguing of fancy food obscure authors and punk bands by the dozen in a misdirected attempt to lend weight and depth to the characters the belly-flop of the second half which was both interminable and meekly fatalistic Also the fact that Henry pitched up butt-naked and middle-aged to scribble all over Clare s childhood blank pages for men to write on of course would piss me off more if she had ever taken the time to resist to struggle to try to reclaim her own destiny But she never did No conflict wrote one reviewer if any conflict arises it s quickly put to bed and never heard from again From alcoholism and recovery to Henry s angsty shitty sexist younger self Niffenegger likes to play with ugly character traits but is much too quick to bury them I m grateful to these reviewers for spilling the guts of this book so I could paw through them I was troubled by many of these aspects but overall my experience was great Part of it is the sci-fi nerd within who adored this take on time-travel I also thoroughly enjoyed all the sex because I love sex and Clare and Henry s intimacy emotional and physical pleased me perhaps because this is my first taste of genre romance in years Plus I ve never seen the movie and I didn t know the book was sickeningly popular or featured in Oprah s book club although in retrospect it seems inevitable I confess I gain substantial personal satisfaction from reading books about nesting eating cuddling just being together in a comfortable space being alive together I cannot expect other readers to share the hibernatory pleasure I took in those passages however and I don t want to read another similar novel again any time soon On another level this book made me hyper-aware of the fragility of time and how quickly it passes and how contingent and tyrannical it can be I ve seen Niffenegger shot down half a hundred times by now but ultimately I took great pleasure in consuming her work Lay it down to one-third naive middle-class wish-fulfilment one-third glorious sci-fi and one-third writing and a plot that captured my mind and my heart more"

"177","The time traveler's wife"," Rain Misoa","did not like it"," I Hate This Book I didn t like a single thing about it No that was a lie I liked the first pages I thought the aspect of time-traveling in this book was amazing It was so fascinating to see all the explainations the author came up with to describe how time travel worked However that s where it ends my friends Everything after that is just so obnoxious you want to burn the book and I don t condone book burning My God it was just awful Niffenegger has an okay writing style At times it is so bland you just want to hang yourself Also she tries way too hard to make her characters sound intelligent when in reality they are so vulgar and stupid She literally tries to use a whole bunch of fancy words that no one NOT EVEN A LIBRARIAN would know the meaning to And what s with all the weird references That s just asking for attention from people who may or may not know about what the author is talking about The characters and I do mean Harry and Clare both are so superficial stuck-up shallow no good egomaniacs They are both obsessed with sex that it drives me mad Don t get me wrong I have nothing against sex It s human nature to want to feel that sort of pleasure and it can be quite beautiful if written correctly However every damn minute you see Clare slip her hands to Harry s nuts Everything about it is so unromantic you start to wonder This is a romance How in the hell is this love Personally I didn t see it It was lust more than anything Yeah this book sucks I m sorry to those who actually enjoyed it but I didn t There s only so much stupid I can take And as most of you know that s not much I guess my advice is to check it out of the library if you are really curious Otherwise just forget this crap It just sucks There are a lot of other amazing books out there Please don t waste your time on this one more"
"178","The time traveler's wife"," snowplum","it was ok"," I would often assert that my critical reviews are objective -- I will dock a book stars for poor pacing internal contradictions flaws in character psychology mundane writing and so forth My criticism of this book I freely admit is subjective But here it is with the hopes that it will help someone decide whether it is a good pick for them I feel like Niffenegger focuses on strangely unappealing aspects of her characters lives It s not that I need the book to be utterly impractically romantic and joyful I could deal with some angst or anger or even some dry science as these characters sort out their complicated premise But to illustrate my point by taking the it to the extreme -- you don t really want Jane Austen to tell you about Mr Darcy going to the bathroom right You don t need to account for everything Holden Caulfield eats for lunch Presumably you don t regret the lack of any passages about Pip s auto erotic habits during adolescence in Great Expectations I would say Niffenegger lacks that inner editor suggesting that she eliminate some of her material about the rather base thoughts and actions of her characters Either she s making them unlikable without meaning to by making them so aggressively common and NOT romantic or else she set out to write a story with a male lead who isn t much of a romantic hero yet she cloaked it and the publishers compounded the problem as a romantic tale which ends up leaving an increasingly bitter taste in your mouth every time Henry is a disappointment Henry is extraordinary only because he travels in time I can t be the only reader who wishes that there were something a little more extraordinary about his character imagination or heart more"

"180","The time traveler's wife"," India","really liked it"," This book took me by surprise Honestly it is not exactly the genre I generally choose for leisure I tend to avoid novels that seem overly romantic and when the movie came out it was adored by the same friends who were smitten with films like the Notebook and P S I Love You There is absolutely nothing wrong with that of course but it is not my cup of tea That being said I loved this book It reminded me of Doctor Who without the added space travel It is the most realistic depiction of time travel I have read thus far Niffeneggar sets her parameters well I think that someone who has zero interest in anything science fiction related but who appreciates a good love story would be interested in this I also think that someone who prefers science fiction to the romantic things would be intrigued by the way that the subject matter is handled I read a few reviews that had issues with the writing style itself I chalk this up to personal preference I did not find it to be badly written I actually found myself lost in beautiful phrases quite often I wish I had my notebook handy as I typed this so that I could share a few with you Perhaps I shall update this again later No promises What I will say is that this story is an emotional rollercoaster but it is not the type to leave you so utterly distraught at the end that you wonder what you did with your heart and are angry at the author for destroying it It left me hopeful happy and satisfied more"
"181","The time traveler's wife"," Shannon","liked it"," First I want to say this was a very creative and interesting book The author had a lot to keep track of and I think she did a fine job of it My problems with the book are mostly technical These are things that snap me back into reality jolt me out of the story Run on sentences If there are two or more instances of and in a sentence it might be time to break it up into more sentences If of the sentences in your book are like that it might be time to go back to school It wasn t so bad coming from Clare s six-year-old voice because kids tend to talk like that and it s okay sometimes when used to make the reader feel like things are moving fast but everywhere else it s annoying Commas Too many Some sentences had so many commas in strange places I couldn t even be sure what the author was trying to say And semicolons I ve never seen so many semicolons in one book before Sometimes it s okay to just start a new sentence Unforgivable One unforgivable use of would of As in I would of done that If you have to say it that way use would ve Probably just a mistake but someone should have caught it Again I liked the story I love time travel There were some things that bothered me but no book is perfect It just would have benefited from another revision or two more"
"182","The time traveler's wife"," Amy","it was amazing"," I refused to read this book for ages because it was a trendy book with a trendy name But now I understand everyone s love for it I suppose that the way to get a sci-fi book to succeed is to not market it as a sci-fi book This book is a time travel novel and it s done quite cleverly The time traveler in question has a genetic mutation that makes him spontaneously time travel so he lands in various times and places quite naked He often runs into himself but he also meets his wife when he s an adult and she s a child While she has known him all her life he only knows her during his adulthood It wasn t difficult to figure out where the book was going and when the roller coaster was going to plunge downhill However the process of reading the novel was quite satisfying The author is able to create a world and quickly bring the reader comfortably inside it to be a watcher in the shadows I m definitely glad I finally broke down to read this book because it s certainly now among my all time favorites more"
"183","The time traveler's wife"," Letitgo","it was amazing"," Henry is a time traveler get over it This is what I eventually had to tell myself In the beginning while reading this story I found myself trying to figure out why Henry time travels Was it some sort of disease was it triggered by some traumatic childhood event was he an alien from outer space trying to fit in As I continued to read it began to dawn on me that I wouldn t get the answer to my question and ultimately the origin of the time traveling thing is not what the story is about I began to read the story as I believe it was intended This is a love story no different from one involving someone with a terminal disease It s about Henry and all that he brings and Claire s desire to love him despite everything There were a few times during the story that were confusing to me and I guess it had to do with Henry s movement from age to age and things he should be aware of or not But overall I found this to be a very touching sweet story that I would recommend to friends more"

"205","The time traveler's wife"," Clara","did not like it"," DNF d this shit because it is so confusing the time travel aspect seems random as hell I am aware that you can t expect a lot of explanations about it but I was expecting something that made some sort of sense the writing is not good and the characters are the worst Henry is a piece of shit mind you I read about a third of the book and he does seems a little bit nicer when he is older but still I didn t like him at all and Clare She s just there to fucking wait for him ALL HER LIFE She reads like a character with no personality because all she thinks about is Henry The secondary characters might as well be made of wood Also they don t have a healthy relationship and considering nothing happened it was a little my fault because I started it without knowing anything I thought it had more substance and it explained a little more the time travelling and how I was not enjoying it at all there is no point in wasting more of my time Also also I looked for the spoilers and man am I glad I stopped reading it more"
"206","The time traveler's wife"," Mbgirl","really liked it"," An inward triumph of love with the main theme of waiting and how waiting overcomes all things even time Grabbed from the withdrawn cart of Westwood LA s library I found this novel a nice hybrid between Ha Jin s Waiting and the blockbuster classic Somewhere in Time Kismet is a tour de force element the adventures of Henry had me laughing out loud and the story read quickly Could this sci fi love novel been edited further Methinks definitely Clare and Henry s story of love will be memorable for me Besides what is a more endearing theme than love that transcends time Celebrating absence makes the heart grow fonder Timeless themes more"

"210","The time traveler's wife"," Bill Khaemba","really liked it"," UPDATE Movie adaptation Don t you think it s better to be extremely happy for a short while even if you lose it than to be just okay for your whole life I am sorry to be in the minority but this was surprisingly good and yet I have no idea why it was as good as I claim it to be It s not the best time travel book that I have ever read but it was such a fun ride Audrey Niffenegger in some parts did this book justice I usually get intimidated by time travel books or movies because they are confusing for me and I usually spend so much time trying to piece together everything she made it simple enough It was disjointed but slowly with each page the pieces fall into place The main premise of the book follows Henry the time traveler and Clare the girlfriend wife Henry randomly disappears and reappears in different time periods of his life and he can t control when it happens so the concept of time traveling in the book is treated as disability and we follow him as he meets his wife at the age of years old and all through her life The cool thing or rather the bad thing is that when Henry disappears he literally leaves everything at that moment and goes back in time naked without identification money or shit so he has to pickpocket steal to survive I loved that whole setting of the book it was such an interesting take on time traveling it showcased such a dark-side of time travel that if I was offered the ability to do that I would be like The book is written in a different format and it worked for me personally and how she went on to diagnose time travel as a disease made the whole thing appear realistic The love story was OK many people go in expecting more science-fiction but end up getting a fluffy book and I get why it s hated on but I tolerated it The only problem with it was Clare the wife wasn t as independent as she always depended on Henry the time traveler and it got so annoying Also the side characters were just placed in the book to make the story move forward I wish they were fleshed out and had depth The problems I had with this book were equally as many A year old man appearing naked in front of year old child The stereo-type black maid Gomez s character Henry looking at a younger Clare sexually Cardboard Side Characters And the ending It was still a good book though and the themes of people suffering with disability alcoholism death depression suicide and many more were touched upon I recommend going in with an open mindFollow my "
